<p>A compound that is increased in healthy dietary patterns,
as it is closely associated with fruit and vegetable intake, is
dietary nitrate(27). It is estimated at the population level, in
Western countries, that dietary nitrate intake is approximately
110 mg/d(28)</p>
<p>A previous review(27) estimated that the nitrate content of healthy dietary patterns, such as the MedDiet or DASH
diet, could be 10-fold higher (approximately 1000–1200 mg/d)
than the estimated average nitrate intake of Western populations
(approximately 110 mg/d)(28) and considerably higher than the
level of nitrate intake currently recommended by the WHO
(3·7 mg/kg of body weight (corresponding to approximately
280 mg/d for a person with a body weight of 70 kg))(29)</p>
<p>The protective effects of dietary nitrate on cardiometabolic
and neurocognitive health have been consistently reported in
randomised trials(19,30). The protective effects of higher levels of nitrate intake (approximately 400–800 mg/d) on cardiometabolic and neurocognitive health
have been consistently reported in randomised trials(19,30).</p>

<p>Some studies have also suggested an interaction with ageing
such that older individuals may need higher nitrate doses to
elicit similar effects on vascular outcomes to those observed in
younger groups(31,32).</p>

<p>Abstract <br>
Dementia is a significant public health priority with approximately 55 million cases worldwide, and this number is predicted to quadruple by
2050. Adherence to a healthy diet and achieving optimal nutritional status are vital strategies to improve brain health. The importance of this area
of research has been consolidated into the new term ‘nutritional psychiatry’. Dietary nitrate, closely associated with the intake of fruits and
vegetables, is a compound that is increased in dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean and MIND diets and has protective effects on cognition
and brain health. Nitrate is characterised by a complex metabolism and is the precursor of the nitrate–nitrite–nitric oxide (NO) pathway con-
tributing to systemic NO generation. A higher intake of dietary nitrate has been linked to protective effects on vascular outcomes including blood
pressure and endothelial function. However, the current evidence supporting the protective effects of dietary nitrate on brain health is less
convincing. This article aims to provide a critical appraisal of the current evidence for dietary nitrate supplementation for improving brain health
and provide suggestions for future research.

<h2>The Nitrate-Nitrite-Nitric Oxide
Pathway on Healthy Ageing: A Review
of Pre-clinical and Clinical Data on the
Impact of Dietary Nitrate in the Elderly</h2>

<p>The pre-clinical and clinical data herein summarised suggest that
diets rich in nitrate may prevent, reverse or mitigate the
physiological decay observed during healthy ageing or age-associated 
disorders. Cardiovascular dysfunction, neurological
deficits and metabolic impairment are the major causes of
morbidity and mortality among older adults but nitrate
supplementation is now emerging as a nutritional approach to
enhance cognitive and functional abilities in the elderly. However,
some questions remain to be answered. For instance, given that
nitrate improves muscle mitochondrial function and oxygen
consumption in young volunteers, how would it impact in
•muscle mitochondria in older adults? Would changes in NO
bioavailability in old subjects interfere with the mitochondrial
effects of nitrate observed in young populations? May
mitochondrial function and intracellular calcium handling
concur to improve muscle contractile function in old subjects?
Finally, given the prevalence of metabolic disorders in the elderly,
it is mandatory to translate the antidiabetic and antilipemic
effects of nitrate observed either in rodents or young
volunteers to old populations. Thus, the impact of nitrate in
the healthy life expectancy should now be studied in large
multicentre trials to ascertain if nitrate-rich diets or
supplements could be used in the more generalised context of
gerontology.</p>

Kim, D.J.K., et al. (2024).
Effects of short-term dietary nitrate supplementation on exercise and coronary blood flow responses in patients with peripheral artery disease.

Findings: Short-term inorganic nitrate supplementation improved coronary blood flow and exercise tolerance in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).

Note: Benefits extended beyond peripheral circulation to coronary perfusion.

Kim et al. (2024)	PAD patients	Improved coronary blood flow and exercise capacity	Short-term benefit
Ferdina & Setiawan (2024)	General population	Boosted NO levels, lowered BP	Prefer dietary sources
Benjamim & Gonçalves (2025)	Middle-aged and older adults	Reduced arterial stiffness, better performance	Need more long-term studies
🧠 Key Points to Remember:
Short-term nitrate supplementation is beneficial in improving vascular and exercise outcomes.
<br><br>
Long-term safety is still uncertain.
<br><br>
Vegetable-based nitrate is safer than isolated chemical forms.
<br><br>
Clinical use is not yet fully mainstream without medical supervision.

Here’s what the latest research says about inorganic nitrate/nitrite supplementation and dementia prevention or reversal:
<br><br>
🧠 Collective Insight (Overview):
Recent studies suggest that inorganic nitrate and nitrite supplementation could improve cerebral blood flow, enhance cognitive performance, and potentially slow cognitive decline associated with aging. However, while small short-term trials show positive trends, no large clinical trial has yet conclusively proven that these supplements can prevent or reverse dementia.
Cognitive benefits seem largely vascular-mediated — improving blood supply to the brain — rather than directly reversing neurodegeneration. Dietary sources (vegetables) are preferred over synthetic supplements.
