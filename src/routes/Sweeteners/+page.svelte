### 🧠 Cognitive and Neurological Effects

A study published in *Neurology* in September 2025 found that higher intake of certain artificial sweeteners, including sucralose, was associated with accelerated cognitive decline. Participants consuming the most artificial sweeteners experienced a 62% faster decline in memory and a 173% faster decline in verbal fluency compared to those with lower consumption. The effect was particularly pronounced in individuals under 60 and those with diabetes ([Health][1]).

Additionally, research from the University of Southern California in March 2025 indicated that sucralose alters brain activity related to hunger, increasing appetite, especially in individuals with obesity. The study found that sucralose consumption led to increased activity in the hypothalamus, a brain region that regulates appetite, and changes in how the hypothalamus communicated with other brain regions. Unlike sugar, sucralose did not trigger the release of hormones that create a feeling of fullness ([Keck School of Medicine of USC][2]).

### 🧬 Metabolic and Gut Health Concerns

Sucralose has been implicated in various metabolic disturbances. A comprehensive review in 2024 highlighted that sucralose consumption is linked to weight gain, insulin resistance, and increased blood pressure. The review suggests that sucralose may disrupt glucose metabolism, alter gut microbiota composition, and contribute to systemic inflammation, all of which are risk factors for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases ([Frontiers][3]).

Furthermore, a study published in *Frontiers in Nutrition* in 2024 reported that sucralose consumption leads to significant alterations in gut microbiota, including a reduction in beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and an increase in pro-inflammatory species. These changes can impair glucose metabolism and contribute to metabolic dysfunction ([Frontiers][3]).

---

### 🧪 Reproductive and Immune System Impacts

Emerging evidence suggests that sucralose may affect reproductive health. A study published in *Environmental Health Perspectives* in 2025 found that chronic oral exposure to sucralose led to decreased sperm viability and dysregulated reproductive function in male rats ([Environmental Health Perspectives][4]).

Additionally, research from the University of Pittsburgh in September 2025 indicated that sucralose may impair the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy by disrupting immune function. The study suggests that sucralose consumption could reduce the body's ability to respond to certain therapies ([The Times of India][5]).

---

### ⚠️ Regulatory and Safety Considerations

Despite these concerns, regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have deemed sucralose safe for consumption within established acceptable daily intake levels. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert in 2023, advising against the use of non-sugar sweeteners, including sucralose, for weight management due to potential health risks ([Wikipedia][6]).

---

### 🧾 Conclusion

While sucralose is widely used as a sugar substitute, recent studies suggest that its consumption may be associated with various health risks, including cognitive decline, metabolic disturbances, reproductive health issues, and impaired immune function. Given these emerging concerns, individuals may consider limiting their intake of sucralose and other artificial sweeteners and opting for natural alternatives. As research continues to evolve, it is advisable to stay informed about the potential health implications of sucralose and make dietary choices accordingly.

New Study Links 6 Artificial Sweeteners to Faster Cognitive Decline
3 days ago — A new study published in *Neurology* on September 3, 2025, has linked six artificial sweeteners with accelerated cognitive decline. Researchers tracked the diets and cognitive performance of 12,772 Brazilian adults over eight years, identifying that higher consumption of certain sugar substitutes correlated with faster declines in memory, verbal fluency, and overall thinking ability. The high intake group showed a 62% faster cognitive decline and 173% faster decline in verbal fluency compared to low consumers—equivalent to 1.6 extra years of brain aging. The effect was pronounced in individuals under 60, and especially those with diabetes, a group more likely to use sugar substitutes. While not definitively causal, the researchers suggest alterations in the gut microbiome and inflammation may be contributing factors. Interestingly, only tagatose was not associated with cognitive decline, while sweeteners like aspartame, saccharin, and others were. Experts highlight the importance of reducing both artificial and added sugars, favoring a diet rich in fiber and whole foods to promote brain health. Alternatives like stevia or tagatose may be safer options.

Sucralose in diet soda might undermine cancer immunotherapy response; study finds a supplement that could help
September 11, 2025 — A recent study conducted by researchers from the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC Hillman Cancer Center has revealed that sucralose, a widely used artificial sweetener commonly found in diet sodas, may impair the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy. The study suggests that patients undergoing such treatments might experience weakened responses when consuming products containing sucralose. However, the research also presents a potential solution: arginine supplementation. Arginine, an amino acid, could help counteract the negative impact of sucralose on cancer immunotherapy outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of dietary choices during cancer treatment and provide a potential avenue for improving therapeutic efficacy through nutritional interventions.

AI Overview
Allulose and Cognitive Decline 
Allulose is a natural sugar found in small amounts in fruits and grains. It has been studied as a potential sugar substitute due to its low glycemic index and minimal impact on blood sugar levels. However, there is limited research on the potential effects of allulose on cognitive function. 
Current Research 
A few studies have investigated the relationship between allulose and cognitive decline. One study in rats found that allulose supplementation improved cognitive function in animals with metabolic syndrome, a condition characterized by obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammation. Another study in mice showed that allulose reduced oxidative stress in the brain, which is a factor associated with cognitive decline. 
However, these studies were conducted in animal models and may not translate to humans. Additionally, the doses of allulose used in these studies were higher than what is typically consumed in the diet. 
Mechanisms of Action 
It is not yet fully understood how allulose may affect cognitive function. Some potential mechanisms include: 
Reducing oxidative stress: Allulose may reduce oxidative stress in the brain, which can damage neurons and contribute to cognitive decline. 
Improving insulin sensitivity: Allulose may improve insulin sensitivity in the brain, which can help regulate blood sugar levels and reduce inflammation. 
Modulating gut microbiota: Allulose may alter the composition of gut microbiota, which has been linked to brain health. 
Conclusion 
Limited evidence suggests that allulose may have beneficial effects on cognitive function, particularly in individuals with metabolic syndrome. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings in humans and to determine the optimal dosage and long-term effects of allulose on cognitive health. It is important to note that allulose is not a substitute for medical advice. If you are concerned about cognitive decline, please consult with a healthcare professional.

A new study found a link between consuming more artificial sweeteners and cognitive decline.
Researchers are still learning more, but it’s possible that these sweeteners could cause inflammation and gut microbiome disruptions that harm the brain.
Experts recommend cutting back on sweet and processed foods in your diet.
Replacing sugar with low- or no-calorie sweeteners is a popular way to manage weight. But a new study found relying on certain sugar substitutes may be bad for your brain health.

The study, published Sept. 3 in Neurology, found that people who consumed the highest amounts of six artificial sweeteners also had the greatest declines in thinking and memory, as compared to those who consumed less. Those declines amounted to 1.6 years of additional brain aging.1

The results don’t mean someone will notice memory issues immediately after drinking a soda sweetened with aspartame, said study author Claudia Kimie Suemoto, MD, PhD, associate professor of geriatrics at the University of São Paulo Medical School in Brazil.

But for people who consume these sweeteners often, “it does mean their brain may be aging at a quicker pace, which over time could increase the risk of earlier or more severe cognitive impairment,” she told Health.

Tracking Links Between Diet and Brain Health
Suemoto and her colleagues looked at data from 12,772 Brazilian adults who were 52 years old on average. At the beginning of the study, the participants filled out questionnaires about what they usually ate and drank over the previous year.2

The research team specifically tracked seven low- and no-calorie sweeteners that show up in common grocery items such as soda, low-calorie desserts, yogurt, or as standalone products:1

Aspartame
Saccharin
Xylitol
Erythritol
Sorbitol
Tagatose
Acesulfame K
The scientists then split participants into groups based on their intake of these low- or no-calorie sweeteners:31

Low: about 20 milligrams (mg) per day
Moderate: about 66 mg per day
High: about 191 mg per day, about the equivalent of one can of diet soda
Over the span of eight years, the participants underwent various cognitive tests, including verbal fluency (how fast they could pronounce words in a given category), word recall, memory, and information processing speed.42

A Strong Connection Between Sweeteners and Worse Cognition
As compared with people who consumed minimal amounts of these low- or no-calorie sweeteners, other participants fared much worse on these cognitive tests, the researchers’ data showed.

On average, the moderate intake group had a 35% faster rate of memory and thinking decline, and a 110% faster rate of verbal fluency decline.1

For the high consumption group, their rate of memory and thinking decline was 62% faster, and their verbal fluency decline was 173% faster.1

Interestingly, this link between low- or no-calorie sweeteners and worse cognition only existed for people under the age of 60.1

“This study is one of the largest to connect several different sweeteners to measurable cognitive decline over time,” Theresa Gentile, MS, RDN, a Brooklyn-based dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told Health.

Were Certain Sweeteners Worse Than Others?
Because the researchers adjusted for diet quality before doing their analysis, all signs point to the fact that “sweeteners themselves add to the risk” of poor brain health, David Perlmutter, MD, a neurologist and fellow of the American College of Nutrition, told Health.

But there wasn’t much of a difference between the sweeteners themselves—tagatose wasn’t associated with cognitive decline at all, the data showed, but the other six sweeteners were.1

“We did not see any evidence that one was worse than the other,” Suemoto noted.

Why Might Sugar Substitutes Have an Effect on Brain Health?
The authors of this latest study emphasized their findings don’t prove sweeteners cause cognitive decline. However, experts have some theories about what might be going on.

Your diet is the largest driver of the pathogens that make up your gut microbiome, Rebecca Solch-Ottaiano, PhD, an assistant professor of pharmacology at the Tulane University School of Medicine, told Health.

So consuming more sugar substitutes may change the composition of your gut microbiome and drive inflammation—however, more research is needed.567 It could simply be that people who eat more artificial sweeteners have a less healthy gut because they don’t eat enough fiber, for example, said Solch-Ottaiano.

Though the exact mechanism isn’t clear, inflammation and microbiome changes can cause the brain’s immune cells (called microglia) to act differently, said Perlmutter. “When microglia shift into that damaging, inflammatory mode, the risk for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other forms of cognitive decline rises,” he said.

Research has linked artificially sweetened beverages with higher risks of dementia and stroke.8 Plus, sucralose—another sugar substitute not included in this study—has been linked to worse memory and executive functioning.9

“The weight of evidence suggests at least some sugar substitutes carry real risks,” Thomas Holland, MD, assistant professor with the Rush Institute for Healthy Aging at Rush University, told Health.

The Diabetes Connection
In general, people under 60 saw greater risks of cognitive decline and early brain aging when they consumed more artificial sweeteners—but that link was even stronger for people with diabetes, the new study found.10

People with diabetes are more likely to consume artificial sweeteners as a substitute for sugar, Suemoto said.2 That consumption—combined with diabetes’s effect on the body—could explain why these patients are at a higher risk, said Perlmutter.

“Diabetes already stresses metabolism and the microbiome, creating a primed inflammatory state,” he said. “Adding artificial sweeteners seems to make that fire burn hotter, which then fuels microglia to become more damaging in the brain.”

Should You Skip the Sweetener?
There’s more research that needs to be done, but sugar substitutes may not be as harmless as we think. So Suemoto advised reducing your consumption when you can.

But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s better to swap these no- and low-calorie options for added sugar—plenty of research has tied sugar intake to dementia and a host of other health issues.1112

It’s challenging, but the best course of action is to retrain your tastebuds to enjoy less sweet foods, Perlmutter said.

“The real goal should be less sweetness overall, less processed food, and more fiber-rich whole foods to support gut bacteria and brain health,” he added.

But when you need a substitute, try less-processed sweeteners such as stevia or tagatose, Perlmutter recommended.
