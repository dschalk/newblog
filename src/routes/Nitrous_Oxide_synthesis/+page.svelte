var t = `“The overall reduction of nitrite by ascorbic acid to nitrous oxide is thermodynamically downhill at every aqueous pH, but the rate of N₂O production shows a bell-shaped dependence on pH.  Two consecutive steps control the kinetics:


NO₂⁻ + 2 H⁺ + e⁻ → NO + H₂O (rate strongly accelerated by acidity because nitrite is protonated to HNO₂).
2 NO + 2 H⁺ + e⁻ → N₂O + H₂O (rate only weakly affected by pH).

Below about pH 4 the first step outruns the second, so NO builds up and the net formation of N₂O actually slows.  Above pH 8 both steps are slow because proton availability is low.  Consequently, in the uncatalysed system the fastest steady production of N₂O is usually observed in the mildly acidic to neutral range (≈ pH 5-7).


Introducing a suitable catalyst (e.g., Cu-nitrite-reductase or Cu-exchanged zeolite) accelerates the second step as well; this narrows the gap between the two half-reactions and can shift the optimum somewhat lower in pH, but even with a catalyst the peak N₂O rate is rarely at the extreme acidic end of the scale.”


In short: thermodynamically feasible everywhere, kinetically optimal around pH 5-7 without a catalyst, and shifted only modestly by catalysis.`
