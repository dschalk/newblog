Answer

This is an interesting question, and the answer depends on cultural, social, and individual factors.

From an evolutionary psychology perspective:

Some theories propose that in many species, including humans, certain behaviors can be interpreted as signals during mate selection. Among these, displays of submissiveness or deference can be context-dependent and may sometimes be interpreted as signals of interest or attraction. For example, in some settings, a woman might adopt a more demure, cooperative, or agreeable demeanor toward a man she finds attractive, possibly as a way of showing openness or receptivity.

Psychological and Sociocultural Context:

Human mating behavior is highly variable and influenced by personality, upbringing, and societal norms. In some cultures, traditional gender roles may encourage women to be more reserved or deferential, especially in early courtship. Still, this doesn't necessarily imply submissiveness in a strict sense, nor is it universal.


Research Findings:


Nonverbal cues (e.g., laughter, eye contact, body language) are significant in signaling attraction.
Some studies have observed that people who are interested in each other may adopt complementary roles—one being more dominant, the other more receptive or yielding—at least temporarily.
Recent research emphasizes that mutual respect, confidence, and equality are valued traits in long-term relationships and that overt submissiveness is neither necessary nor universally appealing.

Key Points:


Some women may adopt more "submissive" behaviors (such as letting the man take the lead in conversation or decision-making), but this is not a rule or biological imperative.
Such behaviors are often contextual and strategic, not indications of inherent submissiveness.
Many women present themselves as confident, assertive, and selective when choosing a mate.

In summary:

Some women may present themselves as slightly more submissive or receptive toward men they are interested in, but this is not universal and tends to be contextually and individually determined. Modern dating culture increasingly values equal footing and mutual respect over strict displays of dominance or submissiveness.


If you're interested in specific psychological or sociological studies on the topic, I can provide references or further details!

Related

Please provide all the references to psychological, sociological, popular, and BDSM information and further details that you can. I'll sift through all off them. I am a mature adult, so don't be concerned about confusing me or upsetting my parents. My research must be comprehensive; otherwise it will be useless, and my time will have been wasted.  Providing reliable journal articles as well as unreliable information that I might deem worthy of debunking. Opinions that play down evolutionary influences and stress unreliable concepts such as statements by some so-called "behavioral science" advocates, even the patently absurd statement, "all behavior is learned"; or statement that give exaggerated weight to social mores and morays -- the following is crucial -- while ignoring the influence of evolutionary factors, such as perpetuating genes by displaying deference and willingness to submit to males most likely to protect and nurture them and their offspring. Males most likely to have surviving and thriving offspring with the female who selected them would tend to be high in social hierarchies, assertive and dominant in interactions with other males, and physically strong. Physical strength would be most important in killing and bringing back prey, and also in protecting their mates from unwanted contact with other males.

Answer

Absolutely, I'll strive to provide as comprehensive an overview as possible, structured broadly into four thematic areas: evolutionary psychology, mainstream social/psychological research, popular/cultural commentary (including media and "pseudo-science"), and BDSM subculture literature. You'll find that the spectrum of opinion and evidence is vast and often contradictory; that's a valuable part of critical research! This is a long answer with many references and suggestions for further reading and debunking.

Evolutionary Psychology and Biobehavioral Literature

Central Hypotheses:


Human mating behaviors, including displays of dominance and submission, are influenced by evolved drives to maximize reproductive success.
Females may (sometimes, in some contexts) display deference to high-status, dominant males as a mate-selection strategy.

Key Points & Debates:


Repeated cross-cultural studies (Buss, 1989; Behavioral and Brain Sciences, "Sex Differences in Human Mate Preferences") show statistically significant female preference for dominant males with social status, but individual differences are huge.
Some critics like Cordelia Fine (Delusions of Gender, 2010) argue that many of these findings are overstated or artefactual.

Mainstream Sociology and Psychology Literature

Key Sociological Arguments:


Social constructionism: "All gender roles are learned, nothing is innate"—this view has lost ground but still has strong supporters, e.g., Anne Fausto-Sterling and some radical socialization theorists.

Representative Works:


Judith Butler, Gender Trouble (1990): Argues that gender—and therefore gendered behaviors—is entirely a social construct.

"Unreliable" Sources/Debatable Claims:

Popular/Media/Online Commentary

Web Sources and Misconceptions:


"Red Pill" and "Men's Rights" internet spaces (e.g., Reddit r/TheRedPill): Often cite evolutionary authority to justify claims that women are "naturally" submissive to high-status men.
Pop-psych books and articles, e.g., "Why Women Love Alpha Males" (Psychology Today blog posts), often oversimplify evolutionary arguments.

Examples of Exaggerated/Unreliable Claims:


Jordan Peterson (YouTube, interviews, and books): Frequently stresses the "dominance hierarchy" as biologically grounded (see 12 Rules for Life).
Roosh V (Return of Kings website, now largely defunct): Paraphrases evolutionary theory ad absurdum, often ignoring nuance and context.
"Pickup artist" forums (e.g., Chateau Heartiste archives): Promulgate that female submission is not only innate but universal and infallible.

Summary Table

Perspective	Key Advocates	Core Claims	Key Critiques
Evolutionary	D. Buss, G. Miller, Symons	Some female submissive behavior evolved as adaptive mate choice	Overlooks plasticity, context, and individual choice
Social Constructivist	Butler, Fine, Fausto-Sterling	All/most gender roles are learned	Ignores heritability & cross-cultural validity
Popular/"Red Pill"	Peterson, Roosh V, PUA forums	Female submission universal, "alpha" mythos	Oversimplifies, cherry-picks evidence
BDSM Literature	Easton & Hardy, Nichols, Weiss	Consensual submission is erotic, not identity	Not generalizable to all relationships


Concluding Note

Submission (and dominance) in female-male relationships exists on a broad spectrum, often reflecting a mixture of evolved psychological predispositions, learned behavior, conscious role-play, and shifting cultural norms.

No single theory explains all observed behaviors or preferences. You are right to be cautious; many public, pop-psych, and even peer-reviewed accounts take one variable and run too far with it, omitting crucial contextual differences—individual, relational, and cultural.
