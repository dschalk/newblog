Adherence to a healthy diet and achieving optimal nutritional status are vital strategies to improve brain health. The importance of this area\nof research has been consolidated into the new term ‘nutritional psychiatry’. Dietary nitrate, closely associated with the intake of fruits and\nvegetables, is a compound that is increased in dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean and MIND diets and has protective effects on cognition\nand brain health. Nitrate is characterised by a complex metabolism and is the precursor of the nitrate–nitrite–nitric oxide (NO) pathway con-\ntributing to systemic NO generation. A higher intake of dietary nitrate has been linked to protective effects on vascular outcomes including blood\npressure and endothelial function. However, the current evidence supporting the protective effects of dietary nitrate on brain health is less\nconvincing. This article aims to provide a critical appraisal of the current evidence for dietary nitrate supplementation for improving brain health\nand provide suggestions for future research. <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/73673F647C780D521F7BFE9B6592D6E0/S0007114522002434a.pdf\">Dietary nitrate and brain health</a></p> <h2>The Nitrate-Nitrite-Nitric Oxide\nPathway on Healthy Ageing: A Review\nof Pre-clinical and Clinical Data on the\nImpact of Dietary Nitrate in the Elderly</h2> <p>The pre-clinical and clinical data herein summarised suggest that\ndiets rich in nitrate may prevent, reverse or mitigate the\nphysiological decay observed during healthy ageing or age-associated \ndisorders. Cardiovascular dysfunction, neurological\ndeficits and metabolic impairment are the major causes of\nmorbidity and mortality among older adults but nitrate\nsupplementation is now emerging as a nutritional approach to\nenhance cognitive and functional abilities in the elderly. However,\nsome questions remain to be answered. For instance, given that\nnitrate improves muscle mitochondrial function and oxygen\nconsumption in young volunteers, how would it impact in\n•muscle mitochondria in older adults? Would changes in NO\nbioavailability in old subjects interfere with the mitochondrial\neffects of nitrate observed in young populations? May\nmitochondrial function and intracellular calcium handling\nconcur to improve muscle contractile function in old subjects?\nFinally, given the prevalence of metabolic disorders in the elderly,\nit is mandatory to translate the antidiabetic and antilipemic\neffects of nitrate observed either in rodents or young\nvolunteers to old populations. Thus, the impact of nitrate in\nthe healthy life expectancy should now be studied in large\nmulticentre trials to ascertain if nitrate-rich diets or\nsupplements could be used in the more generalised context of\ngerontology.</p> <h3>The following information will help interested readers find the articles mentioned below.</h3> <p>🔎 Detailed Recent Studies (2021–2025):\nKim, D.J.K., et al.

However, while small short-term trials show positive trends, no large clinical trial has yet conclusively proven that these supplements can prevent or reverse dementia.\nCognitive benefits seem largely vascular-mediated — improving blood supply to the brain — rather than directly reversing neurodegeneration. Dietary sources (vegetables) are preferred over synthetic supplements. <br/><br/> 🔍 Selected Key Studies (2021–2025):\nRocha, B.S.
