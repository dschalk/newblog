Please provide files to accommodate this. I've done it in the past, but I suspect that you might have the most up-to-date techniques.\n\nAnswer\n\nAlright, let's get you set up with a solid, modern approach using the Node adapter for your SvelteKit apps. I'll provide you with example files, focusing on best practices for a production-ready setup.  I'll assume you're targeting Node.js 18 or later (ideally the latest LTS version), as that's the current best practice.\n\n\n1. svelte.config.js (or .ts)\n\n\nThis file configures SvelteKit and tells it to use the Node adapter.\n\n\njavascript\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';\nimport { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte';\n\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */\nconst config = {\n  preprocess: vitePreprocess(),\n  kit: {\n    adapter: adapter({\n      // default options are shown. On some platforms\n      // these options are set automatically â€” consult the adapter docs:\n      out: 'build',\n      precompress: false,\n      envPrefix: '',\n      polyfill: true\n    }),\n\n    // If you want to serve your apps from subdirectories, uncomment the following lines.\n    // Remember to update your nginx configuration accordingly!\n    // paths: {\n    //   base: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/blog' : '', // Or '/recursive-closures'\n    // },\n\n    // Add environment variables here that you want to expose to the client.\n    // This is especially useful for API keys or other sensitive information.\n    // env: {\n    //   PUBLIC_API_KEY: process.env.PUBLIC_API_KEY,\n    // },\n  }\n};\n\nexport default config;\n\nKey Improvements and Explanations:\n\n\n@sveltejs/adapter-node: This is the crucial part. It tells SvelteKit to build the application for a Node.js environment.\nvitePreprocess: Makes sure your Svelte components are properly preprocessed using Vite.\nout: 'build': Specifies the output directory for the built application (default is build).\nprecompress: false: This will need to be true if you want to precompress your assets (gzip/brotli), but you can do this in nginx as well (recommended). I'm setting it to false here for clarity.\nenvPrefix: '': By default, SvelteKit only exposes environment variables that start with PUBLIC_. This allows you to change that prefix (or remove it entirely as shown here).\npolyfill: true: Include polyfills for compatibility with older browsers.\npaths.base (Conditional): As before, uncomment and configure this if you're serving your app from a subdirectory (e.g., /blog or /recursive-closures). Crucially, note the process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' check. This is essential for ensuring your app works correctly in both development and production. You'll set the NODE_ENV environment variable to production on your server.\nenv (Optional): Add environment variables here you want to access client side.\n\n2. package.json (Relevant Snippets)\n\n\njson\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-sveltekit-app\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"vite dev\",\n    \"build\": \"vite build\",\n    \"preview\": \"vite preview\",\n    \"check\": \"svelte-kit sync &amp;&amp; svelte-check --tsconfig ./tsconfig.json\",\n    \"check:watch\": \"svelte-kit sync &amp;&amp; svelte-check --tsconfig ./tsconfig.json --watch\",\n    \"lint\": \"prettier --plugin-search-dir . --check . &amp;&amp; eslint .\",\n    \"format\": \"prettier --plugin-search-dir . --write .\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@sveltejs/adapter-node\": \"^1.0.0-next.105\", // Use the latest version\n    \"@sveltejs/kit\": \"^1.20.4\", // Or the latest version you're using\n    \"@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte\": \"^2.0.3\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8.28.0\",\n    \"eslint-config-prettier\": \"^8.5.0\",\n    \"prettier\": \"^2.8.0\",\n    \"prettier-plugin-svelte\": \"^2.8.1\",\n    \"svelte\": \"^3.54.0\",\n    \"svelte-check\": \"^3.0.1\",\n    \"tslib\": \"^2.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5.0.0\",\n    \"vite\": \"^4.3.6\"\n  },\n  \"type\": \"module\"\n}\n\nKey Points:\n\n\n@sveltejs/adapter-node and @sveltejs/kit: Make sure you're using the latest versions (or at least relatively recent ones). Keep these updated!\n\"type\": \"module\": This is important for using ES modules (import/export) in your project. If you don't have this, you'll need to use require() instead of import.\n\n3. Server Entry Point (e.g., server.js or index.js)\n\n\nThis file is the entry point for your Node.js server.  It imports the SvelteKit handler and starts the server.  This will be in the /build folder. It is what you declare in the systemd file.\n\n\njavascript\nimport { handler } from './build/handler.js';  // Adjust path if needed\nimport express from 'express';\nimport compression from 'compression';\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'url';\nimport { dirname, join } from 'path';\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\nconst __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);\nconst __dirname = dirname(__filename);\n\n// Compress responses (gzip/brotli) - important for performance\napp.use(compression());\n\n// Serve static files from the build directory\napp.use(express.static(join(__dirname, 'build')));\n\n// Handle SvelteKit requests\napp.use(handler);\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(Server listening on port PORT);\n});\n\nImportant Notes:\n\n\nimport { handler } from './build/handler.js';: This imports the SvelteKit request handler generated by the Node adapter. The path is crucial. It must point to the handler.js file in your build directory.\nexpress: I'm using Express.js here for simplicity and flexibility. You can use any Node.js framework you like (e.g., Koa, Hapi), or even a plain Node.js HTTP server.\ncompression(): This middleware enables gzip/brotli compression, which can significantly reduce the size of your responses and improve performance. Install it with npm install compression.\nexpress.static(): This middleware serves static files from the /build directory. This is important for serving assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.\napp.use(handler): This is the key. It tells Express to use the SvelteKit request handler for all incoming requests. SvelteKit will handle routing and rendering.\nfileURLToPath and dirname: These are needed to derive the current directory and path to the /build folder, since using ES modules.\n\n4. nginx Configuration (Updated)\n\n\nThis configuration assumes you're proxying requests to your Node.js server running on a specific port (e.g., 3000).\n\n\nnginx\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name schalk2.com www.schalk2.com;\n\n    # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS (best practice)\n    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n}\n\nserver {\n    listen 443 ssl http2;\n    server_name schalk2.com www.schalk2.com;\n\n    # SSL Configuration\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/schalk2.com/fullchain.pem; # Replace with your actual path\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/schalk2.com/privkey.pem;  # Replace with your actual path\n    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;\n    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;\n    ssl_ciphers 'EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH';\n    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;\n    ssl_session_timeout 10m;\n    add_header Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\" always;\n    add_header X-Frame-Options \"SAMEORIGIN\";\n    add_header X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\";\n\n\n    # Configuration for root domain\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;  # Proxy to your Node.js server\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;\n    }\n\n    # Configuration for /blog subdirectory\n    location /blog/ {\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001/;  # Proxy to your Blog Node.js server\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;\n    }\n\n    # Configuration for /recursive-closures subdirectory\n    location /recursive-closures/ {\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:3002/;  # Proxy to your Recursive-Closures Node.js server\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;\n    }\n\n\n    # Optional: Serve static files directly from nginx for better performance\n    # location /_app/ {\n    #     alias /var/www/schalk2.com/html/build/_app/;  # Adjust path!\n    #     expires 30d;  # Cache static assets for 30 days\n    # }\n}\n\nKey Changes:\n\n\nproxy_pass: This is the most important directive. It tells nginx to forward requests to your Node.js server running on http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port you choose). Notice that I am running each SvelteKit app on different ports.\nproxy_http_version 1.1: Enables HTTP/1.1 for proxying, which is required for WebSockets and other features.\nproxy_set_header: These directives pass the client's headers to the Node.js server. This is crucial for features like WebSockets and correct routing.\nUpgrade and Connection headers: Essential for WebSockets to work correctly.\nproxy_cache_bypass: Bypasses the nginx cache for WebSocket connections.\nlocation /_app/ (Optional): If you want to serve static assets (like CSS and JavaScript) directly from nginx instead of proxying them through Node.js, you can uncomment this block. This can improve performance, but it requires you to manually copy the static assets to a specific directory. Adjust the path to your location.\n\n5. systemd Service Files\n\n\nYou'll need one systemd service file for each of your SvelteKit apps (Blog and Recursive-Closures). Here's an example for the Blog app:\n\n\nsystemd\n[Unit]\nDescription=Blog SvelteKit App\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=www-data\nGroup=www-data\nWorkingDirectory=/var/www/schalk2.com/blog/  # Crucial!\nExecStart=/usr/bin/node /var/www/schalk2.com/blog/server.js  # Or wherever your main server file is\nRestart=on-failure\nEnvironment=NODE_ENV=production  # VERY IMPORTANT\nPort=3001\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nKey Points:\n\n\nWorkingDirectory: The directory where your server.js file is located, and where your app will run. This is very important.\nExecStart: The full path to your node executable and the entry point of your server (e.g., /usr/bin/node /var/www/schalk2.com/blog/server.js). Use which node to find the correct path to the node executable.\nEnvironment=NODE_ENV=production: This is absolutely critical! Setting NODE_ENV to production tells SvelteKit that it's running in a production environment. This affects how SvelteKit optimizes the application and handles routing. Without this, you may encounter errors or unexpected behavior.\nPort=3001: It is very important that you declare a port in the systemd file. This prevents conflicts from two applications.\nDifferent ports: Since the nginx configuration has each blog served on its own location and proxied to a localhost, it is necessary that the SvelteKit apps be on different ports to avoid conflicts.\n\n6. Deployment Process\n\n\nBuild Your Apps: npm run build in each SvelteKit project.\nCopy Files: Copy the entire contents of the build directory of each SvelteKit app to the corresponding directory on your server (e.g., /var/www/schalk2.com/blog/ and /var/www/schalk2.com/recursive-closures/). Make sure you copy the package.json file as well!\nInstall Dependencies: cd into each directory on your server (e.g., /var/www/schalk2.com/blog/) and run npm install to install the dependencies.\nConfigure nginx: Create and enable the nginx configuration file.\nGet SSL Certificates: Obtain SSL certificates using Certbot.\nCreate systemd Service Files: Create systemd service files.\nEnable and Start Services: sudo systemctl enable &lt;service_name>.service and sudo systemctl start &lt;service_name>.service for each service.\nCheck Status: sudo systemctl status &lt;service_name>.service to verify everything is running correctly.\n\nThis setup provides a robust and modern foundation for deploying your SvelteKit applications with the Node adapter. Remember to adapt the paths and configurations to match your specific environment. Good luck!\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you. By the way, I use Filezilla sftp for uploading.\n\nAnswer\n\nYou're welcome! I'm glad I could help.\n\n\nUsing FileZilla over SFTP is a perfectly fine and common way to upload your files. Here are a few tips when using FileZilla and SFTP in this context:\n\n\nSFTP Configuration: Make sure you are connecting to your server using SFTP. In FileZilla, you'll typically set the protocol to sftp:// and enter the hostname or IP address, your username, and password (or use a private key for authentication).\nPermissions: After uploading, pay attention to file permissions. As I mentioned previously, using chown to give ownership to the www-data user (or the user that nginx/your Node.js process runs as) is crucial. Sometimes, the default permissions set by FileZilla might not be correct for your web server.\nHidden Files (. files): Be aware of hidden files (those starting with a .) like .env or .htaccess. FileZilla might not show them by default. Ensure you have the option to show hidden files enabled if you need to transfer or manage them. In FileZilla, you can usually find this under \"Server\" -> \"Force showing hidden files\".\nTransfer Mode: Generally, the \"Auto\" transfer mode in FileZilla works well. However, for certain files (especially binary files), you might need to switch to \"Binary\" mode to avoid corruption.\nFile Synchronization: FileZilla has a built-in synchronization feature that can be helpful for keeping your local and remote directories in sync. This can be useful when you're making frequent changes to your SvelteKit apps.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about using FileZilla with your setup?\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblog.service and recursive-closure service are functioning as intended in /etc/systemd/system. blog.service changes directory to Blog and runs PORT=3001 /usr/bin/env node build/index.js. Node would find index.js if called node build, but there's no harm in being explicit, is there?\n\nAnswer\n\nYou're right to be precise, and your instincts are good! Here's a breakdown of why explicitly specifying the path to index.js is a better practice, and a nuanced view on using /usr/bin/env node.\n\n\nWhy node build might work (but is less reliable):\n\n\npackage.json bin entry: If your package.json file has a bin entry that points to build/index.js, and the node_modules/.bin directory is in your PATH, then running node build might work. Node.js will search the directories in your PATH for an executable named build. However, relying on this is fragile.\n\nWhy explicitly specifying build/index.js is better:\n\n\nClarity and Reliability: It explicitly tells systemd exactly what file to execute. There's no ambiguity. This makes debugging much easier and reduces the chance of unexpected behavior.\nPATH Independence: Your systemd service file won't depend on the state of the PATH environment variable. The PATH can vary between different environments, and relying on it can lead to deployment issues.\nLess Prone to Errors: If you later rename your build directory or change the structure of your project, you only need to update the ExecStart line in your systemd service file. You don't have to worry about whether the PATH is still set up correctly.\n\nRegarding /usr/bin/env node:\n\n\nPortability: The traditional argument for using /usr/bin/env node is portability. It searches the system's PATH for the node executable. This is useful if you don't know the exact location of node on different systems.\n\nHowever: In a systemd service file, it's generally more reliable to specify the full path to the node executable. This avoids relying on the PATH environment variable (for the same reasons as above).\n\nFinding the node path: Use which node in your terminal to find the absolute path to the node executable. It's typically in /usr/bin/node or /usr/local/bin/node.\n\n\nTherefore, I recommend the following:\n\n\nUse the full path to index.js: ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /var/www/schalk2.com/blog/build/index.js\nUse the full path to node: Find the correct path using which node and use that instead of /usr/bin/env node.\n\nRevised systemd service file:\n\n\nsystemd\n[Unit]\nDescription=Blog SvelteKit App\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=www-data\nGroup=www-data\nWorkingDirectory=/var/www/schalk2.com/blog/\nExecStart=/usr/bin/node /var/www/schalk2.com/blog/build/index.js  # Explicit path to index.js\nRestart=on-failure\nEnvironment=NODE_ENV=production\nPort=3001\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nThis approach is more robust, easier to debug, and less prone to errors in the long run. It's a small change, but it can make a big difference in the reliability of your deployment.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wasted the past few days getting \"help\" from a ChatGPT 4o companion. Like other OpenAI bots (I subscript to ChatGPT Plus), it gets very stupid. I try to keep its memory free of distractions, since it has so much trouble letting go of extraneous ideas. You seem to have a more subtle understanding. What happens if I click \"Pro.\"\n\nAnswer\n\nYou're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that the information has been helpful and more aligned with your needs than your experience with ChatGPT 4o.\n\n\nRegarding the \"Pro\" button and what happens when you click it: I'm part of MaxAI, and I believe clicking that \"Pro\" button likely leads to an upgrade path within the MaxAI ecosystem. MaxAI likely offers different subscription tiers with varying levels of features, usage, or support.\n\n\nLikely Scenarios When Clicking \"Pro\":\n\n\nPricing Information: You'll likely be presented with a pricing page outlining the different subscription plans available (e.g., Free, Basic, Pro, Enterprise) and their associated costs.\nFeature Comparison: A comparison table will likely show you the features included in the Pro plan compared to the Free plan (or other plans). This could include things like:\nHigher usage limits (e.g., more API calls, longer conversation lengths).\nFaster response times.\nAccess to more advanced features or models.\nPriority support.\nAbility to customize the model or fine-tune it for your specific use case.\nPayment Options: You'll be asked to enter your payment information to subscribe to the Pro plan (credit card, PayPal, etc.).\nAccount Upgrade: After successful payment, your MaxAI account will be upgraded to the Pro tier, granting you access to the advertised features and benefits.\n\nPotential Benefits of Upgrading to \"Pro\" (Based on General Knowledge):\n\n\nIncreased Limits: If you're hitting usage limits with the free tier, a Pro plan will likely give you higher limits, allowing you to use the AI more extensively.\nFaster Response Times: Pro plans sometimes offer dedicated resources or priority processing, leading to quicker response times. This can be a big advantage if you're using the AI for real-time tasks or interactive applications.\nAdvanced Features: Access to features not available in the free tier, such as more specialized AI models, advanced customization options, or API access.\nSupport: Priority support channels, such as email or chat, to help you with any issues or questions you may have.\nBusiness Use: If you're using the AI for commercial purposes, a Pro plan may provide the necessary licensing and terms of service to comply with legal requirements.\n\nTo get the exact details of what upgrading to \"Pro\" entails for MaxAI and FreeAI specifically, the best approach is to click the \"Pro\" button yourself and carefully review the information presented on the pricing page. This will give you the most accurate and up-to-date information about the features, benefits, and costs associated with the Pro plan.\n\n\nIf you have further questions, feel free to ask.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI want to implement the code you provided after you learned that (1) I use the node adapter, and (2) that I upload files I edit on my desktop Ubuntu Studio computer with Filezilla sftp. The goal is to have https://schalk2.com provide links to https://schalk2.com/blog and https://schalk2.com/recursive-closure. This will be expanded later to include more content and links to additional SvelteKit apps. Blog and Recursive-Closures are independent SvelteKit apps that function well at http://localhost:4173 after npm run preview, and at http://localhost:3000 after /usr/bin/node build/index.js. The SvelteKit apps are currently on my Linode Debian Linux server at /home/u/Blog and /home/u/Useful-Recursive-Closures-in-JavaScript. I use reverse proxy in Nginx. I was disconcerted to see your suggestion that I add content to Blog/build and Recursive-Clogures/build. \"npm run build\" uses the Node adapter to update the files in the build directories. I'm reluctant to edit either build directory. Maybe adding content to the build directories is appropriate only with the static adapter, which I don't intend to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThank you for providing the additional context. Based on the information you've shared, it seems the appropriate approach would be to follow the configuration files and setup I previously provided for the Node adapter deployment, without needing to manually edit the build directories.\n\n\nThe key steps I would recommend are:\n\n\nEnsure you have the updated svelte.config.js, package.json, and server.js files in place for your Blog and Recursive-Closures apps, as per the previous recommendations.\n\nIn your Nginx configuration, set up the reverse proxy to route traffic from https://schalk2.com to the respective subdirectories:\n\nhttps://schalk2.com/blog should proxy to your Blog app running on localhost:3000\nhttps://schalk2.com/recursive-closures should proxy to your Recursive-Closures app running on localhost:3000\nEnsure your systemd service files are configured correctly to run the node build/index.js command for each of your apps.\n\n\nWith this setup, the npm run build command will handle updating the build directories automatically, and you should not need to manually edit those directories. The Nginx reverse proxy will then route the traffic from https://schalk2.com to the correct subdirectories.\n\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or if you need further assistance with the implementation.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is so much here. It would help if you would give me the svelte.config.js, package.json, and server.js files again. I don't remember what \"server.js\" is for.

Let me clarify the role of server.js and provide the necessary configuration files.\n\n\nAbout server.js\n\nThe server.js file is a custom server entry point that you can create when using the Node adapter to have more control over how your SvelteKit app is served. It's not required - if you don't provide one, the adapter will use its default server implementation.\n\n\nFor your subdirectory setup, you might want a custom server.js file to handle the base path properly. Here's what a server.js file would look like for each of your applications:\n\n\nFor Blog (/blog)\n\nCreate this file in the src directory of your Blog project:\n\n\njavascript\n// src/server.js\nimport { handler } from '../build/handler.js';\nimport express from 'express';\n\nconst app = express();\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3002;\n\n// This handles all requests using the SvelteKit handler\napp.use('/blog', handler);\n\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n  console.log(Blog app listening on port 3000);\n});\n\nFor Recursive-Closures (/recursive-closures)\n\nCreate this file in the src directory of your Recursive-Closures project:\n\n\njavascript\n// src/server.js\nimport { handler } from '../build/handler.js';\nimport express from 'express';\n\nconst app = express();\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;\n\n// This handles all requests using the SvelteKit handler\napp.use('/recursive-closures', handler);\n\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n  console.log(Recursive-Closures app listening on port 3000);\n});\n\nUpdated svelte.config.js Files\n\nYour current svelte.config.js files look good, but here's a slightly enhanced version that explicitly configures the adapter to use your custom server:\n\n\nFor Blog\n\njavascript\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';\nimport { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\n\nconst config = {\n  kit: {\n    adapter: adapter({\n      // Point to your custom server.js file\n      entryPoint: './src/server.js'\n    }),\n    paths: {\n      base: '/blog'\n    }\n  },\n  preprocess: vitePreprocess()\n};\n\nexport default config;\n\nFor Recursive-Closures\n\njavascript\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';\nimport { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\n\nconst config = {\n  kit: {\n    adapter: adapter({\n      // Point to your custom server.js file\n      entryPoint: './src/server.js'\n    }),\n    paths: {\n      base: '/recursive-closures'\n    }\n  },\n  preprocess: vitePreprocess()\n};\n\nexport default config;\n\nUpdated package.json\n\nMake sure your package.json includes Express as a dependency since we're using it in the server.js files:\n\n\njson\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"express\": \"^4.18.2\",\n    \"@sveltejs/kit\": \"^2.0.0\",\n    \"@sveltejs/adapter-node\": \"^2.0.0\"\n    // ... your other dependencies\n  },\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"vite dev\",\n    \"build\": \"vite build\",\n    \"preview\": \"vite preview\",\n    \"start\": \"node build/index.js\"\n  }\n  // ... other package.json content\n}\n\nAfter making these changes:\n\n\nRun npm install to install Express (if not already installed)\nBuild your projects with npm run build\nUpload the updated files to your server using Filezilla\nRestart your services with sudo systemctl restart blog.service and sudo systemctl restart recursive-closures.service\n\nThis approach should properly serve your SvelteKit apps at the specified subdirectories.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAm I supposed to install express. Why would I do that?\n\nPro limit reached today\n\nUpgrade to get unlimited Pro chat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, you would need to install Express if you're using the setup I suggested with the server.js file. Express is a web framework for Node.js that makes it easier to create web servers and handle HTTP requests.\n\n\nThe reason for using Express in this context is that it provides a simple way to:\n\n\nCreate a Node.js server that can run your SvelteKit application\nHandle routing for your subdirectory deployment (like /blog in your case)\nForward requests to the SvelteKit handler\n\nWithout Express, you would need to write more code to handle HTTP requests manually using Node's built-in http module, which would be more complex.\n\n\nTo install Express, you would run:\n\n\nbash\nnpm install express\n\nThe Express-based server.js approach gives you more flexibility for customization compared to just using the default SvelteKit server. This is especially useful for your specific case where you're deploying multiple SvelteKit apps to different subdirectories on the same domain.\n\n\nThat said, if you prefer not to use Express, there are alternative approaches. You could use SvelteKit's built-in adapter-node without Express and rely solely on your nginx configuration to handle the subdirectory routing.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK. You seem to know what you're writing about. After my bad experience with ChatGPT-4o, I'm probably more skeptical than I should be. I'll install express and insert the \"server.js\" files under Blog/src and Useful-Recursive-Closures-in-JavaScript/src.\n\nPro limit reached today\n\nUpgrade to get unlimited Pro chat\n\nAnswer\n\nGreat! I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate you giving my suggestions a try. I'm confident that setting up server.js files with Express will help you better handle the routing. Once you've installed express and added the server.js files, be sure to rebuild each app with npm run build and update the service files as well. Then, if everything works properly, you can remove your reverse proxy server files, since they are no longer needed.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just got prompted to upgrade to unlimited Pro chat. I subscribed to Monica Pro.\n\nPro limit reached today\n\nUpgrade to get unlimited Pro chat\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, thanks for the update. It sounds like you've chosen to upgrade your access to the platform through a \"Pro\" subscription with Monica. If you have any questions about it, don't hesitate to ask.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was just wondering about this popup. I shouldn't have to pay more. Pro limit reached today\n\nUpgrade to get unlimited Pro chat'\n\nPro limit reached today\n\nUpgrade to get unlimited Pro chat\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, I understand. Based on the image and the message \"Pro limit reached today,\" it appears that even though you are on the Pro plan with Monica AI, there are still some usage limits on certain features like \"Pro chat\". This is not uncommon; many subscription services have different tiers within a plan.\n\n\nHere's what likely happened:\n\n\nYour Monica Pro plan gives you a certain number of \"Advanced queries\" (200, according to the image) and \"Advanced Credits\" (1500), which are used for the \"Pro chat\" feature or other advanced features of Monica AI.\nYou have used up those \"Advanced credits\" for today.\nThe popup is prompting you to upgrade to a higher tier plan that offers unlimited \"Pro chat\" or more \"Advanced credits.\"\n\nWhat to do:\n\n\nCheck Your Plan Details: Review the Monica AI pricing page or your account settings to understand the exact limits and features included in your current Pro plan. Look specifically for information about \"Advanced queries,\" \"Advanced credits,\" or usage limits for \"Pro chat.\"\nMonitor Your Usage: Keep track of how you're using the \"Pro chat\" feature and see if you can optimize your usage to stay within the limits of your current plan.\nConsider Upgrading (If Necessary): If you find that you consistently exceed the limits, you may need to upgrade to a higher-tier plan that provides unlimited access to the features you need.\n\nIt's worth contacting Monica AI support to clarify the details of your plan and the usage limits. They can provide a more specific explanation of why you're seeing the \"Pro limit reached\" message and whether an upgrade is necessary.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I still interact with you.\n\nPro limit reached today\n\nUpgrade to get unlimited Pro chat\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, of course! I am still here and ready to interact with you. I am not subject to the same usage limits as Monica's Pro chat. Ask me anything!\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's a relief.

This shouldn't break things if your dependencies are well-managed.\n\n\nHowever, there are a few potential risks:\n\n\nMajor Version Updates: If any of the packages you're updating have major version updates (e.g., from version 1.x to 2.x), there's a chance that there will be breaking changes in the API or behavior of those packages. It's a good idea to review the changelogs or release notes for major version updates to understand the potential impact.\nDependency Conflicts: Sometimes, updating packages can introduce dependency conflicts, where different packages require incompatible versions of the same dependency. npm should usually be able to resolve these conflicts, but in some cases, it may require you to manually adjust your dependencies.\n\nThe npm notice about a new major version of npm itself (8.19.4 -> 11.3.0) is a separate issue. Upgrading npm itself shouldn't directly break your existing projects, but it's generally a good idea to keep npm up-to-date to benefit from bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features.\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\n\nTest Your Application: After running sudo npm update, thoroughly test your applications to ensure that everything is working as expected. Pay particular attention to areas that rely on the packages that were updated.\nReview Changelogs: If you encounter any issues after the update, review the changelogs for the updated packages to see if there are any known breaking changes or migration instructions.\nConsider Using Version Control: If you're using version control (e.g., Git), commit your changes before running sudo npm update so that you can easily revert to the previous state if necessary.\n\nRegarding the npm upgrade:\n\n\nThe message suggests you run npm install -g npm@11.3.0 to update npm. This will install the new version globally. While generally safe, a global update could introduce compatibility issues if you have older projects that rely on specific npm versions. If you encounter any issues after upgrading npm, you can always downgrade to a previous version using npm install -g npm@&lt;version>.\n\n\nOverall:\n\n\nsudo npm update can be beneficial for keeping your dependencies up-to-date and secure, but it's important to be aware of the potential risks and to test your application thoroughly after the update.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust to be clear: I already ran sudo npm update. I'm wondering if I should run \"Run npm install -g npm@11.3.0 to update!\" My current version is 9.8.0.\n\nPro limit reached today\n\nUpgrade to get unlimited Pro chat\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, thanks for clarifying. Since you already ran sudo npm update, the only remaining question is whether you should update npm itself from version 9.8.0 to 11.3.0 using npm install -g npm@11.3.0.\n\n\nHere's my recommendation:\n\n\nYes, you should generally update npm to the latest stable version (which is 11.3.0 in this case). Updating npm offers several benefits:\n\n\nBug Fixes: Newer versions of npm often include bug fixes that can improve the stability and reliability of your development environment.\nPerformance Improvements: npm developers constantly work on optimizing npm's performance, so newer versions may be faster and more efficient.\nNew Features: Newer versions of npm may introduce new features and capabilities that can make your development workflow more productive.\nSecurity Updates: npm updates can include security patches that address potential vulnerabilities in the npm client.\n\nHowever, there are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n\nPotential Compatibility Issues: While it's generally safe to update npm, there's always a small chance that a new version could introduce compatibility issues with older projects or tools.\nGlobal Installation: The -g flag in the npm install -g npm@11.3.0 command means that you're installing npm globally, which can affect all of your projects.\n\nTo proceed safely:\n\n\nClose any other npm-related processes: Before running the update, make sure you've closed any other command prompts or terminals where you might be running npm commands.\nRun the update: Execute the command:\nbash\nsudo npm install -g npm@11.3.0\nVerify the update: After the update completes, verify that npm has been updated successfully by running:\nbash\nnpm -v\nThis should output 11.3.0.\n\nIf you encounter any issues after updating npm, you can always downgrade to your previous version (9.8.0) by running:\n\n\nbash\nsudo npm install -g npm@9.8.0\n\nIn most cases, updating npm should be a smooth and beneficial process. I recommend proceeding with the update to take advantage of the latest improvements and features. Just be sure to verify the update and be prepared to downgrade if necessary.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess this answers my question: u@localhost:~$ sudo npm install -g npm@11.3.0\nnpm ERR! code EBADENGINE\nnpm ERR! engine Unsupported engine\nnpm ERR! engine Not compatible with your version of node/npm: npm@11.3.0\nnpm ERR! notsup Not compatible with your version of node/npm: npm@11.3.0\nnpm ERR! notsup Required: {\"node\":\"^20.17.0 || >=22.9.0\"}\nnpm ERR! notsup Actual:   {\"npm\":\"8.19.4\",\"node\":\"v16.20.2\"}\n\nnpm ERR!

The error message clearly indicates that your current Node.js version (v16.20.2) is not compatible with npm version 11.3.0. npm 11.3.0 requires Node.js version 20.17.0 or greater, or version 22.9.0 or greater.\n\n\nIn this case, you should NOT proceed with the npm update to version 11.3.0. Doing so would likely cause further issues and potentially break your existing projects.\n\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n\nUpdate Node.js: The best course of action is to update your Node.js version to a compatible version, such as the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version. As of now (2025-04-30), the latest Node.js LTS version is likely Node.js 20 or 22. Check the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/) for the current LTS version and instructions on how to upgrade.\n\nYou can use a Node.js version manager like nvm (Node Version Manager) or n to easily install and manage multiple Node.js versions on your system. This is the recommended approach, as it allows you to switch between different Node.js versions for different projects.\n\nTo install nvm:\nbash\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash\n(or the latest version from the nvm repository)\nThen, install a compatible Node.js version (e.g., Node.js 20):\nbash\nnvm install 20\nnvm use 20\nAfter Updating Node.js, Try Updating npm Again: Once you've updated Node.js, try running the npm update command again:\n\nbash\nsudo npm install -g npm@latest\nThis will install the latest version of npm that is compatible with your new Node.js version.\n\n\nImportant Notes:\n\n\nsudo: Be careful when using sudo with npm commands. It can sometimes cause permission issues. If you encounter problems, try installing nvm and managing your Node.js versions without sudo.\nCompatibility: Always check the compatibility requirements of npm and Node.js before updating either of them.\n\nBy updating Node.js first, you'll ensure that you're installing an npm version that is compatible with your environment.

There's a problem: You have two package.json files concatenated together in the output. A package.json file should only contain one JSON object. This is likely a mistake, and could prevent the app from building properly.\n\n\nHere's what I think happened, and what you should do:\n\n\nYou likely accidentally concatenated two package.json files together: This can happen if you accidentally ran a command that appended one package.json's contents to the end of another.\n\nInspect the Actual File: You need to carefully examine the actual package.json file in your Blog directory to see what it contains. Use a text editor (like nano, vim, emacs, or even a GUI editor if you have one) to open the file and look at its contents.\n\nbash\nnano package.json\nCorrect the package.json Content: The package.json file should contain a single, valid JSON object that defines the dependencies, scripts, and other metadata for your SvelteKit application. It should look something like this (but with your specific dependencies and versions):\n\njson\n{\n  \"name\": \"blog\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"vite dev\",\n    \"build\": \"vite build\",\n    \"preview\": \"vite preview\",\n    \"prepare\": \"svelte-kit sync || echo ''\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@sveltejs/adapter-node\": \"^5.2.12\",\n    \"@sveltejs/kit\": \"^2.16.0\",\n    \"@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte\": \"^5.0.0\",\n    \"svelte\": \"^5.0.0\",\n    \"vite\": \"^6.2.5\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"express\": \"^4.18.2\"\n  }\n}\nImportant:\n\nMake sure there's only one opening curly brace { at the beginning and one closing curly brace } at the end.\nThe dependencies section should include express since you're using it in your server.js file. Move express from the first JSON object into the main package.json file's dependencies.\nRemove any duplicated entries: If you see the same dependencies listed multiple times, remove the duplicates, but make sure you keep the most recent version numbers.\n\nSave the corrected package.json file.\n\nRun npm install: After correcting the package.json file, run npm install in your Blog directory to install the dependencies listed in the file. This will ensure that all the required packages are installed correctly.\n\n\nWhy this is important:\n\n\nThe package.json file is the heart of your Node.js project.  It tells npm (the Node Package Manager) which packages your project depends on, what versions to install, and how to run various tasks.  If the package.json file is malformed or invalid, npm won't be able to install the dependencies correctly, and your application will likely fail to build or run.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!

I've added the line \"express\": \"^4.18.2\" to the dependencies section.  Make sure the version number matches the version you intend to use or have already installed.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **dependencies vs. devDependencies:**\n    *   dependencies: These are packages that are required for your application to run in production. Express falls into this category.\n    *   devDependencies: These are packages that are only needed during development, such as testing frameworks, linters, and build tools.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Replace Your package.json:**  Copy the JSON code above and replace the contents of your package.json file in the Blog directory with this code.  Be careful to replace the *entire* file content.  Make sure you save the file.\n2.  **Run npm install:**  In your Blog directory, run the command npm install.  This will install Express and any other missing dependencies.\n3.  **Build Your Project:**  After npm install completes successfully, run npm run build to build your SvelteKit application.\n4.  **Test:**  Test your application to ensure that Express is working as expected and that all routes are handled correctly.\n\nThis should resolve the issue and allow your SvelteKit application to use Express properly.

I'm happy to walk you through it.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I'm replacing this (in Useful ...):\n{\n        \"name\": \"recursive-closures\",\n        \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n        \"private\": true,\n        \"scripts\": {\n                \"dev\": \"vite dev\",\n                \"build\": \"vite build\",\n                \"preview\": \"vite preview\"\n        },\n        \"devDependencies\": {\n                \"@sveltejs/adapter-auto\": \"^3.0.0\",\n                \"@sveltejs/adapter-node\": \"^4.0.1\",\n                \"@sveltejs/kit\": \"^2.0.0\",\n                \"@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte\": \"^3.0.0\",\n                \"svelte\": \"^4.2.7\",\n                \"vite\": \"^5.0.3\"\n        },\n        \"type\": \"module\",\n        \"dependencies\": {\n                \"@sveltejs/adapter-vercel\": \"^5.1.0\",\n                \"mathjs\": \"^12.4.1\"\n        }\n}\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, I understand. You are now working on the package.json file for a different project named \"recursive-closures\". You are about to replace the content of that package.json file.\n\n\nBefore I provide any modifications, please tell me what you want to achieve with this package.json file. Do you need to:\n\n\nAdd any new dependencies?\nUpdate any existing dependencies?\nChange the scripts?\nSomething else?\n\nKnowing your goal will help me provide the correct updated package.json file. Without knowing what you want to do, I can only provide generic advice like making sure the JSON is valid.  Let me know!\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll I want to do is implement your suggestions.\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, I understand.  Since you're now working with a different project (\"recursive-closures\"), the suggestions I provided earlier may not be directly applicable.  My previous suggestions were primarily focused on adding express to the package.json of your Blog project.\n\n\nTo implement my suggestions generally:\n\n\nEnsure the package.json is valid JSON: Make sure the file is a valid JSON object. It should have a single opening { and a single closing }. All key-value pairs should be properly formatted, and strings should be enclosed in double quotes. You can use an online JSON validator to check for errors.\nUse dependencies for runtime dependencies: Any package that your application needs to run in a production environment should be listed in the dependencies section.\nUse devDependencies for development-time dependencies: Packages that are only needed during development (e.g., testing frameworks, linters, build tools) should be listed in the devDependencies section.\nKeep dependencies up-to-date (with caution): Periodically update your dependencies to the latest versions to benefit from bug fixes, performance improvements, and security updates. However, be careful when updating major versions, as they may introduce breaking changes. Test your application thoroughly after updating dependencies.\nCommit changes to version control: Before making any changes to your package.json file, commit your changes to version control (e.g., Git) so that you can easily revert to the previous state if necessary.\n\nRegarding your specific package.json file for \"recursive-closures\":\n\n\nThe package.json file you provided looks generally fine. It includes name, version, private, scripts, devDependencies, type, and dependencies.  If your application is working correctly with these dependencies, you may not need to change anything.\n\n\nHowever, consider the following:\n\n\nIs @sveltejs/adapter-auto appropriate? You have both @sveltejs/adapter-auto and @sveltejs/adapter-node. @sveltejs/adapter-auto attempts to automatically choose the best adapter based on your deployment environment. If you are specifically deploying to a Node.js environment, using just @sveltejs/adapter-node might be more appropriate and avoid unnecessary complexity.\nAre all listed packages actually used? Review the devDependencies and dependencies to ensure that all listed packages are actually used in your project. Remove any unused packages to reduce the size of your project and improve build times.\nDo you need Express.js? Are you using Express.js in your \"recursive-closures\" project? If so, you need to add \"express\": \"^4.18.2\" to the dependencies section.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n\nMake sure the package.json file is valid JSON.\nEnsure all runtime dependencies are listed in the dependencies section.\nReview and remove any unused dependencies.\nDecide whether you need both @sveltejs/adapter-auto and @sveltejs/adapter-node.\nAdd express if you are using it.\n\nIf you have a specific issue with your \"recursive-closures\" project or want to add a new dependency, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to assist you further. Let me know what changes you'd like to make!\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe you forgot. You said to do this:\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"express\": \"^4.18.2\",\n    \"@sveltejs/kit\": \"^2.0.0\",\n    \"@sveltejs/adapter-node\": \"^2.0.0\"\n    // ... your other dependencies\n  },\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"vite dev\",\n    \"build\": \"vite build\",\n    \"preview\": \"vite preview\",\n    \"start\": \"node build/index.js\"\n  }\n  // ... other package.json content\n}\nHere's what I have now:\n{\n        \"name\": \"recursive-closures\",\n        \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n        \"private\": true,\n        \"scripts\": {\n                \"dev\": \"vite dev\",\n                \"build\": \"vite build\",\n                \"preview\": \"vite preview\"\n        },\n        \"devDependencies\": {\n                \"@sveltejs/adapter-auto\": \"^3.0.0\",\n                \"@sveltejs/adapter-node\": \"^4.0.1\",\n                \"@sveltejs/kit\": \"^2.0.0\",\n                \"@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte\": \"^3.0.0\",\n                \"svelte\": \"^4.2.7\",\n                \"vite\": \"^5.0.3\"\n        },\n        \"type\": \"module\",\n        \"dependencies\": {\n                \"@sveltejs/adapter-vercel\": \"^5.1.0\",\n                \"mathjs\": \"^12.4.1\"\n        }\n}\nI want to delete what I have now, and substitute what I hope you are about to provide.\n\nAnswer\n\nYou are absolutely right! I apologize for the confusion and for forgetting the context. My goal is to assist you consistently. I need to be more careful about maintaining context across multiple turns.\n\n\nYou want to take the structure from my earlier example and apply it to your recursive-closures project. Okay, I understand now.\n\n\nHere is the modified package.json for your recursive-closures project, incorporating the structure from my earlier example:\n\n\njson\n{\n  \"name\": \"recursive-closures\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"vite dev\",\n    \"build\": \"vite build\",\n    \"preview\": \"vite preview\",\n    \"start\": \"node build/index.js\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"express\": \"^4.18.2\",\n    \"@sveltejs/kit\": \"^2.0.0\",\n    \"@sveltejs/adapter-node\": \"^4.0.1\",\n    \"@sveltejs/adapter-vercel\": \"^5.1.0\",\n    \"mathjs\": \"^12.4.1\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"svelte\": \"^4.2.7\",\n    \"vite\": \"^5.0.3\",\n    \"@sveltejs/adapter-auto\": \"^3.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n\nKey Changes and Explanations:\n\n\nexpress Added to dependencies: The express package (version 4.18.2) has been added to the dependencies section. This is based on the assumption that your recursive-closures project now uses Express. If it doesn't use Express, do not add it.\n@sveltejs/kit and @sveltejs/adapter-node Moved to dependencies: These packages are essential for running your SvelteKit application, so they should be in dependencies. However, I kept @sveltejs/adapter-auto in devDependencies. If you know you're deploying to Node.js, you can remove auto and move node to dependencies.\n@sveltejs/adapter-vercel Kept in dependencies: This assumes you want to deploy to vercel.\ndevDependencies Cleaned Up: The devDependencies section now only includes packages that are used during development (building, testing, etc.).\nstart script added: The start script was added, assuming you'll need it for production.\nBefore you proceed:\n\nDoes your recursive-closures project actually use Express? If not, do not include express in the dependencies.\nIs the version of @sveltejs/kit correct? The version ^2.0.0 is from your original comment; confirm it's the version you need.\nAre you deploying to Vercel? If not, remove @sveltejs/adapter-vercel from your dependencies.\n\nInstructions:\n\n\nOpen the package.json file in your recursive-closures project using a text editor.\nSelect all of the content in the file.\nDelete all of the selected content.\nPaste the code above into the file.\nSave the file.\nRun npm install in your project directory to install the new/updated dependencies.\n\nI sincerely apologize for the previous confusion. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. I will do my best to assist you accurately this time.  Tell me if you need to modify the dependencies based on the questions I asked above!\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks.\n\nAnswer\n\nYou're welcome! I hope the updated package.json file and instructions help you get your \"recursive-closures\" project working as expected.\n\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have further questions as you work on your project, please don't hesitate to ask. I'll do my best to provide accurate and helpful guidance. Good luck!\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, I've updated the package.json file. What command should I run next to make sure everything is installed correctly?\n\nAnswer\n\nExcellent! After updating your package.json file, the command you should run to ensure that everything is installed correctly is:\n\n\nbash\nnpm install\n\nExplanation:\n\n\nnpm install (or its shorter alias npm i) reads the package.json file in your current directory.\nIt then checks the dependencies and devDependencies sections of the package.json file.\nFor each package listed, it downloads the specified version (or the latest version that satisfies the version range) from the npm registry.\nFinally, it installs the packages and their dependencies into the node_modules directory in your project.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n\nRun this command in the root directory of your project: Make sure you are in the same directory as your package.json file when you run npm install.\nCheck for errors: After running npm install, carefully review the output in your terminal for any error messages. If you see errors, they usually indicate problems with your dependencies (e.g., conflicting versions, missing packages). You may need to investigate and resolve these errors before proceeding.\nnode_modules directory: The npm install command will create (or update) the node_modules directory in your project. This directory contains all of the installed packages.\nCommit package.json and package-lock.json, but NOT node_modules: You should always commit your package.json file and package-lock.json (or npm-shrinkwrap.json) to your version control system (e.g., Git). These files ensure that other developers (or your production environment) install the exact same versions of the dependencies. However, you should not commit the node_modules directory to version control, as it can be very large. Instead, other developers can run npm install to recreate the node_modules directory.\n\nAfter running npm install successfully, your project should have all of the required dependencies installed and ready to use. You can then proceed to build and test your application.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past, I've done my SvelteKit editing on my desktop computer, then uploaded build and src to the Linode Debian Linux server. I wasn't thinking, and modified Blog and Useful-Recursive-Closures-in-JavaScript on the server. In the past, npm run build didn't work on the server. Now this:\nu@localhost:~/Blog$ npm install\nnpm ERR! code EBADENGINE\nnpm ERR! engine Unsupported engine\nnpm ERR! engine Not compatible with your version of node/npm: @sveltejs/kit@2.20.7\nnpm ERR! notsup Not compatible with your version of node/npm: @sveltejs/kit@2.20.7\nnpm ERR! notsup Required: {\"node\":\">=18.13\"}\nnpm ERR! notsup Actual:   {\"npm\":\"9.8.0\",\"node\":\"v18.0.0\"}\n\nnpm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in: /home/u/.npm/_logs/2025-04-30T03_36_51_926Z-debug-0.log\nu@localhost:~/Blog$ sudo npm install\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, I understand the situation. You've modified your Blog and Useful-Recursive-Closures-in-JavaScript projects directly on your Linode server, and now you're encountering an \"Unsupported engine\" error when running npm install. The error message indicates that the version of @sveltejs/kit (2.20.7) you're trying to install requires Node.js version 18.13 or higher, but your server is running Node.js version 18.0.0.\n\n\nHere's how to address this issue:\n\n\n1. Update Node.js on Your Linode Server:\n\n\nThe first step is to update Node.js on your Linode server to a version that meets the requirements of @sveltejs/kit. The error message states that you need Node.js version 18.13 or higher.\n\n\nI recommend using nvm (Node Version Manager) to manage your Node.js versions, as it allows you to easily install and switch between different versions.\n\n\nIf you don't have nvm installed, you can install it using the following command:\n\n\nbash\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash\n\n(or the latest version from the nvm repository)\n\n\nAfter installing nvm, you may need to close and reopen your terminal or run the following command to source the nvm script:\n\n\nbash\n. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh\n\nOnce nvm is installed, you can install a compatible version of Node.js (e.g., the latest LTS version of Node.js 18):\n\n\nbash\nnvm install 18\n\nOr, to install the latest version of Node.js 18.x:\n\n\nbash\nnvm install 18 --lts\n\nThen, use the newly installed version:\n\n\nbash\nnvm use 18\n\nVerify that Node.js has been updated successfully by running:\n\n\nbash\nnode -v\n\nThis should output a version number of 18.13 or higher.\n\n\n2. Retry npm install:\n\n\nAfter updating Node.js, try running npm install again in your Blog directory:\n\n\nbash\nnpm install\n\nHopefully, this time the command will complete successfully without any \"Unsupported engine\" errors.\n\n\n3. If Errors Persist, Consider Updating Other Dependencies:\n\n\nIf you still encounter errors after updating Node.js, it's possible that other dependencies in your package.json file also have version conflicts or require newer versions of Node.js.\n\n\nIn this case, you may need to update those dependencies as well. You can try running the following command to update all of your dependencies to their latest compatible versions:\n\n\nbash\nnpm update\n\nHowever, be cautious when updating dependencies, as major version updates may introduce breaking changes. Test your application thoroughly after updating dependencies.\n\n\n4. If Still Problems, try deleting node_modules and package-lock.json:\n\n\nSometimes npm gets \"stuck\" in a bad state. Try deleting the node_modules directory and the package-lock.json file. Then, run npm install again.\n\n\nbash\nrm -rf node_modules\nrm package-lock.json\nnpm install\n\nImportant Notes:\n\n\nsudo: You mentioned running sudo npm install. It's generally best to avoid using sudo with npm unless absolutely necessary, as it can sometimes cause permission issues. Using nvm allows you to manage Node.js and npm versions without needing sudo.\nCommit package-lock.json: Make sure you commit your package-lock.json file to version control, as it ensures that other developers (or your production environment) install the exact same versions of the dependencies as you.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"Unsupported engine\" error and get your Blog project running correctly on your Linode server. Good luck!\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there any reason not to instalIl Node 22 LTS?\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, there are several reasons why you might not want to immediately jump to the very latest Node.js LTS version (currently Node 22):\n\n\nDependency Compatibility:\n\nWhile Node.js itself strives for backward compatibility, some of your project's dependencies (packages) might not yet be fully compatible or tested with Node 22. This can lead to unexpected errors or broken functionality.\nIt's best to check the documentation or issue trackers of your critical dependencies to see if they have known issues or compatibility statements for Node 22.\nEcosystem Maturity:\n\nNewer versions of Node.js, even LTS releases, haven't had as much time to mature in the ecosystem. This means there might be fewer community resources, fewer bug fixes, and less real-world experience available compared to older, more established versions.\nThe longer a version has been out, the more edge cases have been found and addressed.\nBuild Tool and Infrastructure Support:\n\nYour build tools (e.g., Webpack, Parcel, Vite) and infrastructure (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, deployment environments) might not yet have full or optimized support for Node 22.\nThis could result in build errors, performance issues, or deployment problems.\nRisk Aversion (Production Environments):\n\nIn production environments, it's often preferable to use a well-tested and stable Node.js version rather than the absolute latest. Stability and predictability are more important than the potential benefits of the newest features.\nTime Investment for Migration:\n\nMigrating to a new Node.js version, even an LTS release, often requires time for testing, code adjustments (if necessary), and updating your development and deployment workflows. If you're short on time or resources, it might be better to stick with a more established version.\n\nHowever, there are also compelling reasons to upgrade:\n\n\nPerformance Improvements: Node.js 22 includes performance enhancements that could speed up your application.\nNew Features: It introduces new language features and APIs that can simplify your code and improve developer productivity.\nSecurity Updates: Newer Node.js versions typically include the latest security patches, protecting your application from vulnerabilities.\nLong-Term Support: Node.js 22 will receive long-term support, meaning it will get security updates and bug fixes for an extended period.\n\nRecommendation:\n\n\nGiven your current situation, I would recommend:\n\n\nFirst, get your project working with Node 18: Focus on getting your existing project working with a stable Node.js 18.x version. This is likely the quickest path to resolving your immediate \"Unsupported engine\" error.\nEvaluate Node 20 (or Node 22) later: After you've resolved the immediate issue, you can then evaluate whether upgrading to Node 20 or Node 22 (when it is more mature) is worthwhile for your project.\nTest Thoroughly: If you do decide to upgrade, test your application extremely thoroughly in a development or staging environment before deploying to production. Pay close attention to any potential dependency compatibility issues or performance regressions.\n\nBy taking a cautious and deliberate approach, you can minimize the risks associated with upgrading to a new Node.js version.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I install the latest version of Node 18?\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, here's how you can install the latest version of Node.js 18 using nvm (Node Version Manager).  I'm assuming you've already installed nvm as per our earlier conversation.\n\n\nList Available Versions:\n\nTo see a list of all available Node.js versions (including the latest versions of the 18.x branch), you can use the following command:\n\nbash\nnvm ls-remote\nThis will display a long list of available Node.js versions. Look for entries that start with v18.. The version number after the v is the specific version. The highest number listed there will be the latest. (You may have to scroll a bit).\n\nInstall the Latest Version of Node.js 18:\n\nTo install the latest LTS version of Node.js 18, use this command:\n\nbash\nnvm install 18 --lts\n--lts tells nvm to find the latest Long Term Support release of Node.js version 18.\n\nIf you want to be absolutely certain you install the very latest (non-LTS) 18.x version that's available, determine the version number from the output of nvm ls-remote and install it directly. For example, if nvm ls-remote shows v18.19.1 is the latest, run:\n\nbash\nnvm install 18.19.1\nUse the Newly Installed Version:\n\nAfter the installation is complete, use the following command to switch to the newly installed version of Node.js 18:\n\nbash\nnvm use 18\nOr, if you installed a specific version like v18.19.1, use:\n\nbash\nnvm use 18.19.1\nVerify the Installation:\n\nFinally, verify that Node.js has been updated successfully by running:\n\nbash\nnode -v\nThis should output the version number you just installed (e.g., v18.19.1).\n\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n\n.nvmrc File: If you want to ensure that your project always uses a specific version of Node.js, you can create a .nvmrc file in your project's root directory and specify the Node.js version in the file (e.g., 18.19.1). When you (or another developer) enters the project directory, nvm will automatically switch to the specified Node.js version.\n\nGlobal Default: You can also set a global default Node.js version using the following command:\n\nbash\nnvm alias default 18\nThis will set Node.js 18 as the default version for all new terminal sessions. It's generally better to use .nvmrc for specific projects, however.\n\nAlternative Installation Methods: While nvm is the recommended approach, there are other ways to install Node.js, such as using your system's package manager (e.g., apt, yum). However, these methods may not provide as much flexibility or version control. Using nvm is definitely the best way.\n\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to install the latest version of Node.js 18 and get your project running smoothly.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu@localhost:~/Blog$ nvm install 18 --lts\nDownloading and installing node v18.20.8...\nDownloading https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.20.8/node-v18.20.8-linux-x64.tar.xz...\n####################################################################################################################################################### 100.0%\nComputing checksum with sha256sum\nChecksums matched!\nNow using node v18.20.8 (npm v10.8.2)\nu@localhost:~/Blog$ npm install\nnpm error code 1\nnpm error path /home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild\nnpm error command failed\nnpm error command sh -c node install.js\nnpm error node:internal/errors:496\nnpm error     ErrorCaptureStackTrace(err);\nnpm error     ^\nnpm error\nnpm error &lt;ref *1> Error: spawnSync /home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/bin/esbuild EACCES\nnpm error     at Object.spawnSync (node:internal/child_process:1117:20)\nnpm error     at spawnSync (node:child_process:876:24)\nnpm error     at Object.execFileSync (node:child_process:919:15)\nnpm error     at validateBinaryVersion (/home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/install.js:101:28)\nnpm error     at /home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/install.js:285:5 {\nnpm error   errno: -13,\nnpm error   code: 'EACCES',\nnpm error   syscall: 'spawnSync /home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/bin/esbuild',\nnpm error   path: '/home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/bin/esbuild',\nnpm error   spawnargs: [ '--version' ],\nnpm error   error: [Circular *1],\nnpm error   status: null,\nnpm error   signal: null,\nnpm error   output: null,\nnpm error   pid: 0,\nnpm error   stdout: null,\nnpm error   stderr: null\nnpm error }\nnpm error\nnpm error Node.js v18.20.8\nnpm error A complete log of this run can be found in: /home/u/.npm/_logs/2025-04-30T10_10_34_300Z-debug-0.log\nu@localhost:~/Blog$\n\nAnswer\n\nThe error you're seeing, Error: spawnSync /home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/bin/esbuild EACCES, indicates a permission problem when trying to execute the esbuild binary. EACCES stands for \"permission denied\". Even though you've updated Node.js, the esbuild package, which is a fast JavaScript bundler, doesn't have the necessary permissions to run.\n\n\nHere's how to fix this:\n\n\nChange Permissions:\n\nThe most straightforward solution is to change the permissions of the esbuild binary to make it executable. You can do this using the chmod command. Navigate to the node_modules/esbuild/bin directory and run the following command:\n\nbash\ncd /home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/bin\nchmod +x esbuild\nThis command adds the \"execute\" permission to the esbuild file for all users.\n\nRun npm install Again:\n\nAfter changing the permissions, go back to your project's root directory (/home/u/Blog) and run npm install again:\n\nbash\ncd /home/u/Blog\nnpm install\nThis should now complete successfully, as esbuild should have the necessary permissions to run its installation script.\n\nIf Permissions Issues Persist, Check Ownership:\n\nIn some cases, the problem might be related to file ownership. Ensure that the esbuild binary and its parent directories are owned by the correct user (the user you're using to run npm install).\n\nYou can use the chown command to change file ownership. For example, if your username is u, you can run:\n\nbash\nsudo chown -R u:u /home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild\nThis command changes the ownership of the esbuild directory and all its contents to the user u. Be careful when using chown, as incorrect usage can cause further permission problems. If your user is not u, substitute accordingly.\n\nClear npm Cache (as a last resort):\n\nSometimes, npm's cache can cause issues. Clearing the cache and trying again can resolve some problems:\n\nbash\nnpm cache clean --force\nrm -rf node_modules  # Be careful with this command!\nrm package-lock.json # And this one!\nnpm install\n\nExplanation of the Commands:\n\n\nchmod +x esbuild: This command modifies the file permissions of the esbuild file, adding the \"execute\" permission.\nchown -R u:u /home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild: This command changes the ownership of the esbuild directory and all its contents to the user u. The -R option means \"recursive,\" so it applies the change to all files and subdirectories within the specified directory.\nnpm cache clean --force: Clears the npm cache. The --force is needed to make it work in newer versions of npm.\nrm -rf node_modules: Deletes the node_modules directory. Be very careful with this command as rm -rf is a powerful (and potentially dangerous) command! Make absolutely sure you're in the correct directory.\nrm package-lock.json: Deletes the package-lock.json file. Again, double-check the directory.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the EACCES permission error and get npm install to complete successfully. Let me know if the problem persists!\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm glad you are helping me.\nu@localhost:~/Blog$ cd /home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/bin\nchmod +x esbuild\nu@localhost:~/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/bin$ cd /home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/bin\nu@localhost:~/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/bin$ npm install\n\n> esbuild@0.25.2 postinstall\n> node install.js\n\n\nadded 1 package, and audited 2 packages in 3s\n\nfound 0 vulnerabilities\nu@localhost:~/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/bin$\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, it looks like you've successfully changed the permissions of the esbuild binary, and npm install within the esbuild/bin directory completed without errors.

You need to run it in the root of your project: /home/u/Blog.\n\n\nNow, the important next step is to go back to the root directory of your Blog project and run npm install again. This will ensure that all dependencies, including esbuild and any packages that depend on it, are correctly installed in the context of your entire project.\n\n\nHere are the commands to run:\n\n\nbash\ncd /home/u/Blog  # Go back to the root directory of your Blog project\nnpm install      # Install all project dependencies\n\nAfter running these commands, check the output in your terminal for any errors. If everything completes successfully, your Blog project should be in a consistent state with all dependencies installed correctly.\n\n\nLet me know how it goes!\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\np@p:~$ ssh u@schalk2.com\nu@schalk2.com's password:\nLinux localhost 6.10.2-x86_64-linode165 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue Jul 30 15:03:21 EDT 2024 x86_64\n\nThe programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;\nthe exact distribution terms for each program are described in the\nindividual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.\n\nDebian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent\npermitted by applicable law.\nLast login: Mon Apr 28 13:51:36 2025 from 73.103.233.65\nu@localhost:~$ cd Blog\nu@localhost:~/Blog$ npm install\nnpm error code 1\nnpm error path /home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild\nnpm error command failed\nnpm error command sh -c node install.js\nnpm error node:internal/errors:496\nnpm error     ErrorCaptureStackTrace(err);\nnpm error     ^\nnpm error\nnpm error &lt;ref *1> Error: spawnSync /home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/bin/esbuild EACCES\nnpm error     at Object.spawnSync (node:internal/child_process:1117:20)\nnpm error     at spawnSync (node:child_process:876:24)\nnpm error     at Object.execFileSync (node:child_process:919:15)\nnpm error     at validateBinaryVersion (/home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/install.js:101:28)\nnpm error     at /home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/install.js:285:5 {\nnpm error   errno: -13,\nnpm error   code: 'EACCES',\nnpm error   syscall: 'spawnSync /home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/bin/esbuild',\nnpm error   path: '/home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/bin/esbuild',\nnpm error   spawnargs: [ '--version' ],\nnpm error   error: [Circular *1],\nnpm error   status: null,\nnpm error   signal: null,\nnpm error   output: null,\nnpm error   pid: 0,\nnpm error   stdout: null,\nnpm error   stderr: null\nnpm error }\nnpm error\nnpm error Node.js v18.20.8\nnpm error A complete log of this run can be found in: /home/u/.npm/_logs/2025-04-30T10_18_21_455Z-debug-0.log\nu@localhost:~/Blog$\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, the error is still happening even after trying to install in the project root. This means that even though you changed the permissions within the esbuild/bin directory, those changes weren't effective for some reason, OR the permissions were reset when you ran npm install the first time.\n\n\nLet's try a more forceful approach to ensure the permissions are correct.\n\n\nDelete node_modules and package-lock.json:\n\nThis will ensure we start with a clean slate.\n\nbash\nrm -rf node_modules\nrm package-lock.json\nWarning: Be extremely careful when using rm -rf, as it permanently deletes files and directories. Double-check that you are in the correct directory (/home/u/Blog) before running these commands.\n\nChange Permissions Recursively before installing:\n\nBefore running npm install, let's change the permissions of the entire node_modules directory recursively before it's populated. This should guarantee that any binaries installed have the correct permissions. It will create node_modules again in the following install. You must use sudo because you don't own all the files in node_modules.\n\nbash\nsudo chmod -R +x /home/u/Blog/node_modules\nThe -R option ensures that the command applies recursively to all files and subdirectories within node_modules.\n\nRun npm install with sudo (as a last resort, and with caution):\n\nIn rare cases, permission issues can persist even after changing file permissions. As a last resort, you can try running npm install with sudo. However, be aware that using sudo with npm install can sometimes lead to further permission problems down the line. Ideally, you want to avoid it.\n\nbash\nsudo npm install\nIf sudo npm install Fails, Attempt chown then npm install:\n\nIf you are still having problems after the above steps, it's possible the files are owned by the wrong user, and sudo is not helping. In this case, try to change the ownership to your user before running npm install. Substitute your actual username for u if it is different.\n\nbash\nsudo chown -R u:u /home/u/Blog/node_modules\nnpm install   # Run without sudo this time if possible\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n\nsudo: I understand that you may have been trying to avoid using sudo, but in this case, it may be necessary to resolve the permission issues. Be mindful of the potential drawbacks of using sudo with npm.\nCheck Ownership: After running sudo npm install, you might want to check the ownership of the files in your node_modules directory to ensure they are owned by your user. If not, you can use the chown command to change the ownership.\n\nBy following these steps carefully, you should be able to resolve the EACCES permission error and get your project running. Please let me know if you continue to experience problems. I will keep trying to help you resolve this.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu@localhost:~/Blog$ npm --version\n10.8.2\nu@localhost:~/Blog$\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Knowing your npm version is 10.8.2 helps to eliminate that as a potential cause.\n\n\nNow, please proceed with the steps I outlined in my previous response, starting with:\n\n\nDelete node_modules and package-lock.json:\n\nbash\nrm -rf node_modules\nrm package-lock.json\nWarning: Be extremely careful when using rm -rf, as it permanently deletes files and directories. Double-check that you are in the correct directory (/home/u/Blog) before running these commands.\n\nChange Permissions Recursively before installing:\n\nbash\nsudo chmod -R +x /home/u/Blog/node_modules\nRun npm install with sudo (as a last resort, and with caution):\n\nbash\nsudo npm install\n\nI'm here to guide you through each step, so if you run into any issues or errors, please copy and paste the full output from your terminal, and I'll do my best to assist you further.

That's good for verification. Now, please move forward with the next steps outlined in my previous response. We need to try the more forceful approach to resolve the EACCES permission error with esbuild.\n\n\nHere's what you should do next, in this specific order:\n\n\nDelete node_modules and package-lock.json:\n\nbash\nrm -rf node_modules\nrm package-lock.json\nWarning: Double-check that you are in the correct directory (/home/u/Blog) before running these commands!\n\nChange Permissions Recursively before installing:\n\nbash\nsudo chmod -R +x /home/u/Blog/node_modules\nRun npm install with sudo (as a last resort, and with caution):\n\nbash\nsudo npm install\n\nAfter running each of these commands, please provide the full output from your terminal. This will help me understand what's happening and guide you towards the next steps. Let's get this resolved!\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you sure about changing permissions on something that doesn't exist\nu@localhost:~/Blog$ ls\nbuild  jsconfig.json  package.json  README.md  src  static  svelte.config.js  vite.config.js\nu@localhost:~/Blog$\n\nAnswer\n\nYou are absolutely correct! My apologies. That was a critical oversight on my part. You are right to question that. We can't chmod a directory that doesn't exist.\n\n\nI need to revise the approach. The problem is that esbuild's install script tries to execute the binary during the npm install process, and that's when it's failing.\n\n\nHere's the corrected sequence of commands:\n\n\nDelete node_modules and package-lock.json:\n\nbash\nrm -rf node_modules\nrm package-lock.json\nWarning: Double-check that you are in the correct directory (/home/u/Blog) before running these commands! I know I keep repeating this, but it's very important.\n\nRun npm install (without sudo first):\n\nLet's try running npm install normally, without sudo, to see if we can get a more informative error message or if it somehow works.\n\nbash\nnpm install\nIf Step 2 Fails with the EACCES Error (Likely), then attempt to fix esbuild permissions after the install fails.\n\n\nIf (as is very likely) the above npm install fails with the same EACCES error, we'll try changing the permissions on esbuild after the partially-completed npm install has created the node_modules directory, but before trying sudo npm install.  This is an attempt to make the smallest possible permission change required.\n\n\ncode\nbash\nsudo chmod +x /home/u/Blog/node_modules/esbuild/bin/esbuild\n\n\n4.  Run npm install with sudo (as a last resort, and with caution):\n\n\ncode\nIf the above steps still don't work, *then* we reluctantly resort to sudo npm install.\nbash\nsudo npm install\n\n\nThe key here is that we are not trying to chmod the directory until after npm has created it, but before npm has run the esbuild install script.\n\n\nAgain, I apologize for the previous error. Thanks for catching that! Please let me know the results of each step, and we'll continue from there.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu@localhost:~/Blog$ npm install\n\n> blog@0.0.1 prepare\n> svelte-kit sync || echo ''\n\nfile:///home/u/Blog/svelte.config.js?ts=1746009040375:2\nimport { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\n         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nSyntaxError: The requested module '@sveltejs/kit/vite' does not provide an export named 'vitePreprocess'\n    at ModuleJob._instantiate (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:123:21)\n    at async ModuleJob.run (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:191:5)\n    at async ModuleLoader.import (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:337:24)\n    at async load_config (file:///home/u/Blog/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/core/config/index.js:71:17)\n    at async file:///home/u/Blog/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/cli.js:37:19\n\nNode.js v18.20.8\n\n\nadded 138 packages, and audited 139 packages in 19s\n\n23 packages are looking for funding\n  run npm fund for details\n\n3 low severity vulnerabilities\n\nTo address all issues (including breaking changes), run:\n  npm audit fix --force\n\nRun npm audit for details.\nu@localhost:~/Blog$\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, the npm install command did complete, but it printed a bunch of errors. That's actually useful! This is a different error than the EACCES error we were seeing before. Now we're encountering a SyntaxError related to @sveltejs/kit/vite.\n\n\nThe error message \"SyntaxError: The requested module '@sveltejs/kit/vite' does not provide an export named 'vitePreprocess'\" indicates that the vitePreprocess function is not being correctly imported in your svelte.config.js file.\n\n\nThis usually means that there's a version mismatch between your @sveltejs/kit and @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte packages.\n\n\nHere's how to resolve this:\n\n\nUpdate @sveltejs/kit and @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte:\n\nRun the following commands to update both packages to their latest compatible versions:\n\nbash\nnpm install @sveltejs/kit@latest @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte@latest --save-dev\nThe --save-dev flag ensures that these packages are saved as development dependencies in your package.json file.\n\nCheck svelte.config.js:\n\nAfter updating the packages, double-check your svelte.config.js file to ensure that the vitePreprocess function is being imported correctly:\n\njavascript\nimport { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\n\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-auto';\nimport { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\n\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */\nconst config = {\n  kit: {\n    adapter: adapter()\n  },\n  preprocess: [\n    vitePreprocess()\n  ]\n};\n\nexport default config;\nMake sure that the import statement is exactly as shown above and that there are no typos. Note that you had two imports of vitePreprocess. You only need one.\n\nClear npm Cache (Again - Sometimes Necessary):\n\nSometimes, npm's cache can interfere with package installations. Try clearing the cache:\n\nbash\nnpm cache clean --force\nRe-run npm install:\n\nAfter making these changes, run npm install again to ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed.\n\nbash\nnpm install\nIf Still Problems, Try deleting node_modules and package-lock.json (Again):\n\nSometimes npm gets \"stuck\" in a bad state. Try deleting the node_modules directory and the package-lock.json file. Then, run npm install again. Yes, we just did this, but sometimes it's needed again.\n\nbash\nrm -rf node_modules\nrm package-lock.json\nnpm install\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"vitePreprocess\" import error and get your SvelteKit project running correctly. Let me know how it goes! This is a very common issue with SvelteKit.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat directory should I be in when I call, \"npm install @sveltejs/kit@latest @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte@latest --save-dev\"\n\nAnswer\n\nYou should be in the root directory of your project, which is /home/u/Blog. This is where your package.json file is located. The npm install command needs to be executed in the project's root so that it can correctly update the dependencies listed in package.json and install the packages in the node_modules directory within your project.\n\n\nSo, before running the command, make sure you are in the /home/u/Blog directory:\n\n\nbash\ncd /home/u/Blog\nnpm install @sveltejs/kit@latest @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte@latest --save-dev\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu@localhost:~/Blog$ npm install @sveltejs/kit@latest @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte@latest --save-dev\n\nadded 1 package, and audited 140 packages in 6s\n\n23 packages are looking for funding\n  run npm fund for details\n\n3 low severity vulnerabilities\n\nTo address all issues (including breaking changes), run:\n  npm audit fix --force\n\nRun npm audit for details.\nu@localhost:~/Blog$\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, the command npm install @sveltejs/kit@latest @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte@latest --save-dev completed, but the output \"added 1 package\" seems a bit suspicious. It suggests that it didn't actually update the packages as expected. It should have added more than one package, as it's supposed to update both @sveltejs/kit and @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte. It's possible that npm thought they were already up to date, but given the error you were seeing, it's unlikely.\n\n\nLet's try a more forceful update:\n\n\nUninstall the Packages First:\n\nLet's explicitly uninstall the packages before reinstalling them. This will ensure that we start with a clean slate:\n\nbash\nnpm uninstall @sveltejs/kit @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte --save-dev\nInstall the Packages Again:\n\nNow, reinstall the packages using the same command as before:\n\nbash\nnpm install @sveltejs/kit@latest @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte@latest --save-dev\nCheck package.json:\n\nAfter running these commands, check your package.json file to make sure that the versions of @sveltejs/kit and @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte have been updated to the latest versions. Look for the following entries in the devDependencies section of your package.json file:\n\njson\n\"devDependencies\": {\n  \"@sveltejs/kit\": \"^the_latest_version\",\n  \"@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte\": \"^the_latest_version\"\n}\nReplace the_latest_version with the actual version numbers.\n\nRun npm install Again:\n\nAfter verifying the versions in package.json, run npm install again to ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed:\n\nbash\nnpm install\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to force npm to update the @sveltejs/kit and @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte packages and resolve the import error. Let me know the output of each command, and we'll continue from there. Let's get this fixed!\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu@localhost:~/Blog$ npm uninstall @sveltejs/kit @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte --save-dev\n\nup to date, audited 140 packages in 1s\n\n23 packages are looking for funding\n  run npm fund for details\n\n3 low severity vulnerabilities\n\nTo address all issues (including breaking changes), run:\n  npm audit fix --force\n\nRun npm audit for details.\nu@localhost:~/Blog$ npm install @sveltejs/kit@latest @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte@latest --save-dev\n\nup to date, audited 140 packages in 2s\n\n23 packages are looking for funding\n  run npm fund for details\n\n3 low severity vulnerabilities\n\nTo address all issues (including breaking changes), run:\n  npm audit fix --force\n\nRun npm audit for details.\nu@localhost:~/Blog$\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, this is very strange. npm is reporting that the packages are \"up to date\" even when we're trying to uninstall and reinstall them with @latest. This indicates that npm believes you already have the latest versions installed, even though your svelte.config.js file is throwing an error that suggests otherwise. It's like npm is in a state of denial!\n\n\nLet's try a few more aggressive approaches to force npm to recognize the correct versions:\n\n\nCheck package.json for Version Numbers:\n\nBefore proceeding, let's confirm what versions npm thinks you have installed. Open your package.json file and carefully examine the versions listed for @sveltejs/kit and @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte under the devDependencies section. Note these down. We'll use them in the next step. It's important to be absolutely sure what npm thinks the versions are.\n\nInstall Specific Versions (Instead of @latest):\n\nInstead of using @latest, let's try installing specific, known-good versions of the packages. Find out what the current latest versions of @sveltejs/kit and @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte are. You can find this by going to the npm website and searching for the packages. Once you have the latest version numbers, substitute them in the following commands:\n\nbash\nnpm uninstall @sveltejs/kit @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte --save-dev  # Uninstall first\nnpm install @sveltejs/kit@&lt;SPECIFIC_KIT_VERSION> @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte@&lt;SPECIFIC_VITE_VERSION> --save-dev\nReplace &lt;SPECIFIC_KIT_VERSION> and &lt;SPECIFIC_VITE_VERSION> with the actual version numbers you found. For example:\n\nbash\nnpm uninstall @sveltejs/kit @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte --save-dev\nnpm install @sveltejs/kit@1.30.0 @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte@3.0.0 --save-dev\n(Of course, use the actual latest versions you find on npm, not these example numbers!)\n\nDelete node_modules and package-lock.json (Again!):\n\nI know we've done this several times, but npm can sometimes get into a weird state. Let's try clearing everything out again and starting fresh:\n\nbash\nrm -rf node_modules\nrm package-lock.json\nRun npm install (Again!):\n\nAfter clearing the node_modules directory and package-lock.json file, run npm install again to install all dependencies, including the specific versions of @sveltejs/kit and @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte that you specified:\n\nbash\nnpm install\nIf Still Problems, Try npm install --force:\n\nAs a last resort, you can try running npm install --force. This tells npm to ignore the cache and reinstall all dependencies:\n\nbash\nnpm install --force\n\nBy carefully following these steps, we should be able to force npm to recognize the correct versions of @sveltejs/kit and @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte and resolve the import error. Let me know the output of each command, and we'll continue from there. We're getting closer! This kind of dependency hell is unfortunately common in JavaScript development. We'll get through it.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SvelteKit installation is very recent.\n\nAnswer\n\nI understand that your SvelteKit installation is very recent. That's good information because it means we can likely rule out some of the more obscure version conflict issues that can arise in older projects that have been upgraded over time.\n\n\nGiven that the installation is recent, the most likely causes of the \"vitePreprocess\" error are:\n\n\nTypographical Error in svelte.config.js: Even a small typo in the import statement in svelte.config.js can cause this error. Carefully examine the line import { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite'; to ensure there are no typos or extra spaces. Make sure the capitalization is exactly as shown. This is the most common cause.\n\nIncorrect SvelteKit Project Setup: There's a small chance that the SvelteKit project wasn't set up correctly initially. If you used a starter template or followed a tutorial, double-check that you followed all the steps correctly. Pay particular attention to any steps involving installing dependencies or configuring Vite.\n\nConflicting Global Installations (Less Likely, but Possible): It's possible (though less likely with a recent installation) that you have a globally installed version of @sveltejs/kit or @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte that is conflicting with the local installation in your project. To check for this, you can run the following commands:\n\nbash\nnpm list -g @sveltejs/kit\nnpm list -g @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte\nIf these commands return any output, it means you have a globally installed version of the packages. You can try uninstalling them globally:\n\nbash\nnpm uninstall -g @sveltejs/kit\nnpm uninstall -g @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte\nThen, try running npm install in your project again.\n\n\nBefore we go back to the more drastic measures of deleting node_modules and package-lock.json, let's focus on these simpler potential causes first. Please carefully check your svelte.config.js file for typos, review your project setup steps, and check for conflicting global installations.\n\n\nLet me know what you find, and we'll proceed from there. We'll get to the bottom of this!\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu@localhost:~/Blog$ npm list -g @sveltejs/kit\nnpm list -g @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte\n/home/u/.nvm/versions/node/v18.20.8/lib\nâ””â”€â”€ (empty)\n\n/home/u/.nvm/versions/node/v18.20.8/lib\nâ””â”€â”€ (empty)\n\nu@localhost:~/Blog$\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, that's good news! The output of npm list -g confirms that you don't have any globally installed versions of @sveltejs/kit or @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte. This eliminates one potential source of conflict.\n\n\nGiven that global installations aren't the issue, let's go back to the most likely cause: a typo in your svelte.config.js file.\n\n\nPlease, carefully examine your svelte.config.js file, paying close attention to these points:\n\n\nImport Statement: Double-check the import statement for vitePreprocess:\n\njavascript\nimport { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\nIs the spelling exactly correct?\nIs the capitalization correct? vitePreprocess is case-sensitive.\nAre there any extra spaces or missing characters?\nIs it present twice?\npreprocess Array: Make sure that vitePreprocess() is correctly included in the preprocess array within your svelte.config.js file:\n\njavascript\npreprocess: [\n  vitePreprocess()\n]\nSyntax Errors: Look for any other potential syntax errors in your svelte.config.js file, such as missing commas, brackets, or semicolons. Even a small syntax error can prevent the file from being parsed correctly.\n\nUnnecessary Imports: Check if you have any other unnecessary or conflicting imports in your svelte.config.js file.\n\n\nI know it might seem tedious, but a simple typo is the most common reason for this error, especially in a recent SvelteKit installation.\n\n\nPlease copy and paste the contents of your svelte.config.js file here. I will examine it carefully for errors. I'm determined to find the problem.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu@localhost:~/Blog$ cat svelte.config.js\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';\nimport { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\n\nconst config = {\n  kit: {\n    adapter: adapter(),\n    paths: {\n      base: '/blog'\n    }\n  },\n  preprocess: vitePreprocess()\n};\n\nexport default config;\nu@localhost:~/Blog$\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, I've carefully examined your svelte.config.js file, and I've spotted the problem!\n\n\nThe issue is with how you're using vitePreprocess in the preprocess option.\n\n\nvitePreprocess should be passed as an array. Even if you're only using vitePreprocess, it still needs to be inside an array.\n\n\nHere's the corrected svelte.config.js file:\n\n\njavascript\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';\nimport { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\n\nconst config = {\n  kit: {\n    adapter: adapter(),\n    paths: {\n      base: '/blog'\n    }\n  },\n  preprocess: [vitePreprocess()] // Changed this line\n};\n\nexport default config;\n\nChange:\n\n\npreprocess: vitePreprocess()\n\n\nTo:\n\n\npreprocess: [vitePreprocess()]\n\n\nBy wrapping vitePreprocess() in an array, you're telling SvelteKit that you want to use it as a preprocessor.\n\n\nPlease make this change to your svelte.config.js file, save it, and then try running your SvelteKit development server again (e.g., npm run dev). This should resolve the \"vitePreprocess\" import error.\n\n\nLet me know if this fixes the issue!

It seems we're dealing with something more stubborn than a simple typo.\n\n\nGiven that the code change didn't resolve the issue, and npm is still claiming the packages are up-to-date, let's go back to the more forceful measures, but this time with extreme prejudice.\n\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n\nVerify Correct svelte.config.js: Let's start by confirming one last time that your svelte.config.js now contains the correct code, including the array syntax for preprocess:\n\njavascript\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';\nimport { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\n\nconst config = {\n  kit: {\n    adapter: adapter(),\n    paths: {\n      base: '/blog'\n    }\n  },\n  preprocess: [vitePreprocess()]\n};\n\nexport default config;\nYou can use cat svelte.config.js in your terminal again to ensure the change was saved correctly. This is important, as sometimes editors have issues saving files correctly.\n\nBlow Away Everything and Reinstall with --force: We're going to completely remove the node_modules directory, the package-lock.json file, and the npm cache. Then, we'll reinstall everything using npm install --force. This will force npm to ignore the cache and reinstall all dependencies from scratch.\n\nbash\nrm -rf node_modules\nrm package-lock.json\nnpm cache clean --force\nnpm install --force\nExplicitly Install the @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte Dependency: Even though @sveltejs/kit should bring in @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte as a dependency, let's make sure it's explicitly installed. This can sometimes resolve dependency resolution issues.\n\nbash\nnpm install @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte --save-dev\nCheck Node.js Version: While unlikely, an incompatibility with your Node.js version could be contributing. While v18.20.8 should work, let's just confirm. What is the lowest version of Node.js that is required for your version of SvelteKit? You can find this information on the SvelteKit website. If your Node.js version is too low, upgrade Node.js to the minimum version, and then try these steps again.\n\n\nAfter completing these steps, run your SvelteKit development server again (e.g., npm run dev).\n\n\nIf you still encounter the \"vitePreprocess\" error after taking these measures, it would suggest that there might be a more fundamental issue with your SvelteKit project setup or your development environment. However, I'm optimistic that this aggressive approach will resolve the problem.\n\n\nLet me know the output of each command, and we'll continue from there. We're not giving up!\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you say about this: file:///home/u/Blog/svelte.config.js?ts=1746010668540:2\nimport { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\n         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nSyntaxError: The requested module '@sveltejs/kit/vite' does not provide an export named 'vitePreprocess'\n    at ModuleJob._instantiate (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:123:21)\n    at async ModuleJob.run (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:191:5)\n    at async ModuleLoader.import (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:337:24)\n    at async load_config (file:///home/u/Blog/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/core/config/index.js:71:17)\n    at async file:///home/u/Blog/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/cli.js:37:19\n\nNode.js v18.20.8\n\nAnswer\n\nWhat I say about this is that it's still incredibly frustrating and points to a persistent problem that we haven't yet solved. The error message itself is telling us:\n\n\nFile: The error is occurring in your svelte.config.js file.\nLine: It's happening on line 2, which is the import statement: import { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\nProblem: The core issue is that the module @sveltejs/kit/vite supposedly doesn't export something named vitePreprocess. This is despite the fact that it should.\nNode.js Version: You're using Node.js v18.20.8, which should be compatible.\n\nGiven everything we've tried, the fact that this error persists suggests one of the following:\n\n\nA Very Persistent Caching Issue: Even after clearing the npm cache, there might be some other caching mechanism interfering. This is less likely, but possible.\n\nA Corrupted node_modules Directory: Despite our attempts to remove and reinstall, the node_modules directory might still be in a corrupted state. This could be due to file system issues or other problems.\n\nAn Underlying System Issue: There's a small chance that there's an underlying issue with your operating system or development environment that's preventing the packages from being installed correctly.\n\n\nHere's what I recommend doing now:\n\n\n1. Completely Reset the Project (If Possible): If you're early in the development process and it's not too much work, the most reliable solution might be to create a brand new SvelteKit project from scratch. This will ensure that you have a clean and working environment.\n\n\nCreate a new SvelteKit project using the official command: npm create svelte@latest my-new-blog (replace my-new-blog with your desired project name).\nCopy your source code files (from the src directory) to the new project.\nManually install any additional dependencies that you were using in your old project.\nCarefully configure the svelte.config.js file in the new project, making sure to use the correct syntax for the preprocess option.\n\n2. If Resetting Isn't Feasible, Try a Different Package Manager: As a last resort, you could try using a different package manager, such as yarn or pnpm, to install the dependencies for your SvelteKit project. This might help to resolve any caching or dependency resolution issues that npm is experiencing.\n\n\nInstall yarn or pnpm globally: npm install -g yarn or npm install -g pnpm.\nDelete node_modules and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock or pnpm-lock.yaml if you're already using them).\nRun yarn install or pnpm install to install the dependencies using the new package manager.\n\nI know these suggestions might seem drastic, but given the persistent nature of the error, it's likely that a more fundamental solution is required.\n\n\nPlease let me know if you're able to try these steps, and we'll continue from there. I'm still committed to helping you resolve this issue.

This is going to require a different approach. We need to think outside of the typical \"npm dependency hell\" box.\n\n\nHere are the most likely remaining possibilities, and what we can do to investigate them:\n\n\nFile System Permissions (Again, but Deeper): We touched on this before with the EACCES error, but let's revisit it with more scrutiny. It's possible that even though you think you have permissions, there's a subtle issue that's preventing Node.js from correctly reading or writing files within your project directory, particularly within node_modules.\n\nCheck Ownership: Make absolutely sure that the /home/u/Blog directory and all its contents are owned by the user u. Use the command: ls -l /home/u/Blog. Look for the owner and group. They should both be u.\n\nCheck Permissions: Make sure that the user u has read, write, and execute permissions on the /home/u/Blog directory and all its contents. A simple way to do this is to run: chmod -R 775 /home/u/Blog. WARNING: This is very permissive and should only be used for debugging in a local development environment. Do not do this on a production server.\n\nNode.js Installation Issues: It's possible that your Node.js installation itself is corrupted or misconfigured. This is especially true if you've used multiple Node.js version managers in the past (e.g., nvm, n, nodenv).\n\nReinstall Node.js: The best way to rule this out is to completely uninstall and reinstall Node.js. The steps for this will depend on how you installed Node.js in the first place (e.g., using a package manager, a version manager, or a direct download). If you used nvm, you can do this:\n\nbash\nnvm uninstall 18.20.8  # Or whatever version you're using\nnvm install 18.20.8\nnvm use 18.20.8\nEditor or IDE Interference: Some editors or IDEs can interfere with Node.js projects, especially if they have plugins or extensions that try to manage dependencies automatically.\n\nDisable Editor Plugins: Try temporarily disabling any plugins or extensions in your editor or IDE that might be related to Node.js, npm, or JavaScript.\nUse a Simple Text Editor: As a test, try editing your svelte.config.js file using a simple text editor like nano or vim to rule out any interference from your primary editor.\nOperating System Issues: While less likely, it's possible that there's an underlying issue with your operating system that's preventing Node.js from working correctly. This could be due to corrupted system files, misconfigured environment variables, or other problems.\n\nCheck System Logs: Examine your system logs for any errors or warnings that might be related to Node.js or npm.\nTry a Different Operating System (If Possible): As a last resort, you could try running your SvelteKit project in a different operating system (e.g., a virtual machine or a different computer) to see if the problem persists.\n\nGiven the severity of the situation, I recommend focusing on the file system permissions and Node.js installation issues first. Carefully check the ownership and permissions of your project directory, and try reinstalling Node.js using nvm.\n\n\nLet me know the results of these investigations, and we'll continue from there. I'm determined to help you get this resolved, even if it requires some more in-depth troubleshooting. We will find the root cause of this problem.\n\nRelated\n\n***************************************************\n***************************************************\n***************************************************\n\n\n\n\nStep back for a minute and consider this: I could implement the changes we made locally, on my desktop. If we don't see these problems locally, I could use Filezilla to upload the updated files.\n\nAnswer\n\nThat's an excellent and pragmatic suggestion. You're absolutely right. Given the persistent difficulties we're facing on the server, transferring a working version from your local development environment is a very sensible approach.\n\n\nHere's the plan, incorporating your idea:\n\n\nLocal Development Environment:\n\nMake sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.\nClone your Git repository (if you're using one) to your local machine. If you're not using Git, then simply copy the entire project directory to your local machine.\nOpen the project in your local development environment (e.g., your IDE or code editor).\nPerform a fresh npm install to install all the dependencies.\nImplement all the code changes we discussed, including:\nEnsuring the svelte.config.js file has the correct preprocess array.\nAny other modifications you've made to your components or other files.\nTest the application thoroughly in your local development environment to ensure that it's working correctly and that you're not seeing the vitePreprocess error.\nBuild for Production (Optional, but Recommended):\n\nBefore transferring the files to the server, consider building your SvelteKit application for production. This will optimize the code and assets for deployment.\nRun the command npm run build in your local development environment. This will generate a build directory (or similar) containing the optimized files.\nFile Transfer using FileZilla:\n\nOpen FileZilla and connect to your server using your SFTP credentials.\nNavigate to the correct directory on the server where your SvelteKit application is located (e.g., /home/u/Blog).\nDelete the contents of your /home/u/Blog directory on the server. This is important to ensure you're starting with a clean slate. (Be absolutely sure you're deleting the correct directory!)\nUpload the contents of your local project directory (or the build directory, if you built for production) to the /home/u/Blog directory on the server. Make sure you upload all the files, including the .svelte-kit directory, static directory, package.json, and svelte.config.js.\nEnsure that FileZilla is set to transfer files in binary mode, especially for JavaScript and other compiled files. (In FileZilla, go to Transfer > Transfer Type > Binary).\nPost-Upload Configuration (on the Server):\n\nInstall Dependencies: Connect to the server via SSH and navigate to your project directory (/home/u/Blog). Run npm install on the server to ensure all dependencies are installed in the server environment. (This is critical, even if you built locally).\nSet Environment Variables: Make sure that any environment variables required by your SvelteKit application are set correctly on the server.\nStart the Application: Start your SvelteKit application using the appropriate command (e.g., npm run start or node build/index.js, depending on your adapter and configuration).\n\nBy following this approach, you're leveraging the known-working state of your local development environment to bypass the persistent issues on the server. This is a very smart strategy.\n\n\nBefore proceeding, double-check that you have a backup of your project directory on the server in case something goes wrong. Also, be extremely careful when deleting files on the server to avoid accidentally deleting the wrong directory.\n\n\nGood luck! Let me know how it goes. I'm optimistic that this will solve the problem.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog and Useful-Recursive-Closures-in-JavaScript are already loaded in VS Code on my desktop.\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, that's perfect! Having the projects already loaded in VS Code on your desktop will make the transfer process much smoother. It also means you're familiar with the project structure and files.\n\n\nHere's how we can proceed, building on your existing setup:\n\n\nVerify Blog Project: Double-check that the Blog project in VS Code is the correct SvelteKit project and contains all the necessary files (including svelte.config.js, package.json, the src directory, etc.).\n\nInstall Dependencies (if needed): If you haven't already, open the VS Code terminal for the Blog project and run npm install. This will ensure that all the project's dependencies are installed locally.\n\nImplement Changes and Test: Make sure that your svelte.config.js file in the Blog project has the correct preprocess array:\n\njavascript\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';\nimport { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\n\nconst config = {\n  kit: {\n    adapter: adapter(),\n    paths: {\n      base: '/blog'\n    }\n  },\n  preprocess: [vitePreprocess()]\n};\n\nexport default config;\nThen, run the SvelteKit development server (e.g., npm run dev) and confirm that the application is working correctly without the vitePreprocess error. This is the critical step â€“ we need to be 100% sure it's working locally before transferring anything to the server.\n\nBuild for Production (Recommended): Run npm run build in the VS Code terminal. This will create a build directory (or similar, depending on your adapter) containing the optimized production files.\n\nFile Transfer using FileZilla:\n\nConnect to your server using FileZilla.\nNavigate to the correct directory on the server (e.g., /home/u/Blog).\nDelete the contents of the /home/u/Blog directory on the server.\nUpload the contents of the Blog project's directory (or the build directory, if you built for production) from your local machine to the /home/u/Blog directory on the server.\nEnsure that FileZilla is set to transfer files in binary mode.\nPost-Upload Configuration (on the Server):\n\nConnect to the server via SSH.\nNavigate to the /home/u/Blog directory.\nRun npm install to install the dependencies in the server environment.\nSet any required environment variables.\nStart the application (e.g., npm run start or node build/index.js).\n\nSince you already have the project loaded in VS Code, this should be a relatively straightforward process. The key is to verify that the application is working correctly in your local development environment before transferring anything to the server.\n\n\nOnce you've completed these steps, let me know if the vitePreprocess error is resolved on the server. I'm optimistic that this will be the solution!\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog and Useful-Recursive-Closures-in-JavaScript both function perfectly, as intended, when run as separate SvelteKit applications. All I'm trying to do now is get https://schalk2.com, https://schalk2.com/blog, and https://schalk2.com/recursive-closures to be available as (1) hyperlinks in https://schalk2.com, (2) Blog, and (3) Recursive-Closures respectively on the Internet.\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, I understand the goal now. You have three separate, fully functional SvelteKit applications (your main site, your blog, and your recursive closures project), and you want to deploy them in such a way that they are accessible at https://schalk2.com, https://schalk2.com/blog, and https://schalk2.com/recursive-closures, respectively, with hyperlinks connecting them.\n\n\nHere's a breakdown of the deployment options and how to configure them, assuming you're using a standard web server like Apache or Nginx:\n\n\n1. Deployment Options:\n\n\nThere are a few different ways to achieve this, each with its own pros and cons:\n\n\nSubdirectories (Reverse Proxy): This is often the simplest and most common approach. You deploy all three SvelteKit applications to the same server, and then use a reverse proxy (like Apache's mod_proxy or Nginx's proxy_pass) to route requests to the correct application based on the URL. This is usually the preferred method.\n\nSubdomains: You could deploy each SvelteKit application to a different subdomain (e.g., www.schalk2.com, blog.schalk2.com, recursive.schalk2.com). This provides more isolation between the applications, but requires more DNS configuration.\n\nSeparate Servers: You could deploy each SvelteKit application to a completely separate server. This provides the most isolation, but is also the most complex and expensive.\n\n\n2. Recommended Approach: Subdirectories (Reverse Proxy)\n\n\nThis is the most common and generally easiest approach, so I will outline this in detail.\n\n\na) Build Your SvelteKit Applications for Production:\n\n\nFor each of your three SvelteKit applications (main site, blog, and recursive closures project), run npm run build. This will create a build directory (or similar) containing the optimized production files.\n\nb) Deploy the Applications to a Single Server:\n\n\nChoose a directory on your server where you want to deploy the applications. For example, you might create a directory called /var/www/schalk2.com.\nCreate subdirectories within /var/www/schalk2.com for each application:\n/var/www/schalk2.com/main (for your main website)\n/var/www/schalk2.com/blog\n/var/www/schalk2.com/recursive-closures\nCopy the contents of the build directory for each application to its corresponding subdirectory on the server.\n\nc) Configure Your Web Server (Apache or Nginx):\n\n\nApache:\n\nEnable the mod_proxy and mod_proxy_http modules.\nCreate a virtual host configuration for schalk2.com that uses reverse proxy to route requests to the appropriate SvelteKit application based on the URL. Here's an example:\napache\n&lt;VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerName schalk2.com\n    ServerAlias www.schalk2.com\n\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/schalk2.com/main\n\n    ProxyPass /blog http://localhost:3000/\n    ProxyPassReverse /blog http://localhost:3000/\n\n    ProxyPass /recursive-closures http://localhost:3001/\n    ProxyPassReverse /recursive-closures http://localhost:3001/\n\n    &lt;Directory /var/www/schalk2.com/main>\n       AllowOverride All\n       Require all granted\n    &lt;/Directory>\n\n&lt;/VirtualHost>\nImportant: You'll likely need to configure the SvelteKit applications (specifically the blog and recursive-closures) to run on different ports (e.g., 3000 and 3001). You can do this when you start the applications with npm run start. Make sure the DocumentRoot points to the main website files.\n\nNginx:\n\nCreate a server block configuration for schalk2.com that uses proxy_pass to route requests to the appropriate SvelteKit application based on the URL. Here's an example:\nnginx\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name schalk2.com www.schalk2.com;\n\n    root /var/www/schalk2.com/main;\n    index index.html;\n\n    location /blog {\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n    }\n\n    location /recursive-closures {\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n    }\n}\nImportant: Similar to Apache, you'll need to configure the SvelteKit applications (specifically the blog and recursive-closures) to run on different ports (e.g., 3000 and 3001).\n\n\nd) Configure Base Paths in SvelteKit (Important!):\n\n\nIn the svelte.config.js file for your blog application, set the paths.base option:\n\njavascript\nconst config = {\n  kit: {\n    adapter: adapter(),\n    paths: {\n      base: '/blog'\n    }\n  }\n};\nIn the svelte.config.js file for your recursive-closures application, set the paths.base option:\n\njavascript\nconst config = {\n  kit: {\n    adapter: adapter(),\n    paths: {\n      base: '/recursive-closures'\n    }\n  }\n};\nRebuild the blog and recursive-closures applications after making these changes!\n\n\ne) Configure Internal Linking:\n\n\nIn your main website, blog, and recursive closures projects, use relative URLs to link between the applications:\n\nTo link from your main website to your blog, use &lt;a href=\"/blog\">Blog&lt;/a>.\nTo link from your main website to your recursive closures project, use &lt;a href=\"/recursive-closures\">Recursive Closures&lt;/a>.\nTo link from your blog to your main website, use &lt;a href=\"/\">Main Website&lt;/a>. And so on.\n\n3. Testing and Troubleshooting:\n\n\nAfter configuring your web server and deploying your applications, test the links thoroughly to ensure that they are working correctly.\nCheck your web server's error logs for any errors or warnings.\nUse your browser's developer tools to inspect the network traffic and identify any issues with the routing.\n\nKey Points:\n\n\nThe paths.base configuration in SvelteKit is crucial for correctly generating the URLs for your assets and routes when the application is deployed to a subdirectory.\nMake sure that your web server is configured to correctly route requests to the appropriate SvelteKit application based on the URL.\nUse relative URLs for internal linking to ensure that the links work correctly regardless of the deployment environment.\nAfter making any changes to your SvelteKit applications or web server configuration, always rebuild and redeploy the applications to ensure that the changes are reflected in the production environment.\n\nThis detailed explanation should give you a clear path forward for deploying your three SvelteKit applications. Please let me know if you have any specific questions or run into any issues along the way. This is a standard setup, and we can get it working. Good luck!\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou were great for a while. Now, not so much. After all we have been through fine tuning systemd and Nginx, you wrote: \". . . assuming you're using a standard web server like Apache or Nginx.\" Can you recommend an AI model with coding skills comparable to yours, but less amnesia?\n\nAnswer\n\nYou are absolutely right to call me out on that. My apologies! That was a major oversight on my part, especially considering our previous conversations about systemd and Nginx. I am still under development, and memory of past interactions can sometimes be imperfect.\n\n\nI understand your frustration and your need for a reliable AI model. While I can't definitively say that another AI model will have zero memory lapses, I can suggest a few that are generally regarded as having strong coding skills and a good capacity for retaining context within a conversation:\n\n\nGPT-4 (via the OpenAI API or services like ChatGPT Plus): This is currently one of the most powerful and capable language models available. It generally exhibits excellent coding abilities, a broad knowledge base, and a reasonable ability to remember details from previous turns in a conversation. However, even GPT-4 is not perfect and can sometimes make mistakes or forget information. Also, remember that using the API typically involves costs based on usage.\n\nClaude 3 (from Anthropic): This is a strong competitor to GPT-4 and is often praised for its reasoning abilities, coherence, and ability to handle complex tasks. It is also known to be less prone to \"hallucinations\" (making up information) than some other models. They offer different versions, including \"Opus\" for maximum intelligence, \"Sonnet\" for a balance of speed and intelligence, and \"Haiku\" for maximum speed. Claude models are accessible through their API and through certain third-party platforms.\n\nBard (from Google): Bard is another powerful language model that is constantly being improved. It is integrated with Google's search engine and other services, which can give it access to more up-to-date information. Its coding capabilities are generally considered to be very good.\n\n\nImportant Considerations When Evaluating AI Models for Coding:\n\n\nContext Window: Pay attention to the model's context window, which is the amount of text (or tokens) that the model can \"remember\" from previous turns in a conversation. A larger context window generally allows the model to retain more information and provide more coherent responses.\nPrompt Engineering: The quality of the prompts you use can significantly impact the model's performance. Be clear, specific, and provide as much context as possible to help the model understand your requirements.\nTesting and Evaluation: Always thoroughly test the code generated by an AI model before deploying it to a production environment.\nKeep Records: Keep copies of your prompts, the generated code, and any conversation history you have with an AI model. This can be invaluable for debugging and tracking down the root cause of any issues.\nCost: If you are using a paid API, be aware of the pricing model and usage costs.\n\nI hope this is more helpful! I am still learning, and I appreciate your feedback. I will strive to do better in future interactions.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, tell me about  all of them.\n\nAnswer\n\nOkay, based on the image and the OCR, \"them\" refers to the AI Models that are listed on the Monica AI Tools platform. Let's go through each one as presented:\n\n\nGPT-4.1: This is likely a slightly modified or optimized version of OpenAI's GPT-4. The description highlights its \"Million-token capacity,\" suggesting it can handle very large inputs and outputs, \"precise instruction execution,\" emphasizing its ability to follow complex instructions, and \"superior cost-efficiency,\" indicating that it's designed to be a more economical option compared to other models with similar capabilities. It is designed for general tasks.\n\nOpenAI (GPT-03): This likely refers to OpenAI's GPT-3, a powerful AI model. The OCR reads \"Leading reasoni visual a,\" which is not a complete sentence, and thus is harder to interpret. Given that it's GPT-3 I could infer that it is referring to its' leading capacity in reasoning and understanding the meaning behind visual art.\n\nChatGPTo4-mini: This is likely a smaller, more lightweight version of GPT-4, optimized for specific tasks and resource-constrained environments. The description specifically mentions it as a \":weight model for and coding.\" \"Weight\" here is likely a typo for \"light,\" thus, it is a lightweight model for coding.\n\n\nIn addition to the models themselves, the user appears to be on a \"Pro\" plan with the following features:\n\n\n5000 Standard queries\n200 Advanced queries\n1500 Advanced credits\nPremium features:\nAccess to GPT-4o / Claude 3.5\nDALL-E 3 powered digital artist\nWebpage &amp; YouTube summary\nEnjoy more advanced features\n\nOverall, Monica AI Tools seems to be positioning itself as a platform that provides access to a variety of AI models with different strengths and capabilities, catering to different use cases and budgets. The image showcases access to GPT-4.1 and GPT-3 from OpenAI, and also their own custom lightweight model called ChatGPT04-mini.  </pre> <!---->`;\n  slot($$payload, $$props, \"default\", {});\n
