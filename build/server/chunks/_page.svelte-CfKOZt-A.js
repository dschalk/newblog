I thought everyone, including elderly people, benefit from consuming sufficient carbohydrates to occasionally raise blood glucose. Some advocates for this recommendation try to train their bodies to use ketones or glucose, depending on which is available. But this article suggests that it is better to go all out keto; i.e., maintain a ketogenic diet.  An article captioned, "Ketogenic diet raises brain blood flow by 22% and BDNF by 47% in new study" at https://www.psypost.org/ketogenic-diet-raises-brain-blood-flow-by-22-and-bdnf-by-47-in-new-study/ states: 
 
"A new study published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism found that a ketogenic diet significantly increased cerebral blood flow and the levels of a protein that supports brain health in cognitively healthy adults. The findings suggest that this dietary approach, often associated with weight loss and epilepsy treatment, may also enhance brain function in people without cognitive impairment.Under normal dietary conditions, the brain relies heavily on glucose for fuel. However, when carbohydrate intake drops significantly, the body shifts into a metabolic state known as ketosis. In this state, the liver converts fat into ketone bodies—mainly β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone—which can cross the blood-brain barrier and serve as an alternative energy source for the brain.A ketogenic diet is designed to mimic the effects of fasting by drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and increasing fat consumption. Typically, this type of diet provides around 70–75% of calories from fat, 20% from protein, and only 5–10% from carbohydrates. The goal is to shift the body’s metabolism toward fat oxidation and ketone production.The rationale behind the study was based on emerging evidence that ketone bodies might not only serve as a backup fuel source for the brain but could also have direct benefits for brain health. 

Previous research has shown that individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease often have difficulty using glucose effectively in the brain. Because ketones bypass some of the pathways affected in these conditions, they may help compensate for impaired glucose metabolism and restore energy balance.In addition to acting as fuel, ketone bodies may also influence brain signaling pathways, inflammation, and the production of protective proteins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which supports neuron survival and synaptic function. The researchers wanted to find out if these benefits would also apply to cognitively healthy individuals.To test their hypothesis, the scientists conducted a controlled trial involving 11 cognitively healthy adults who were between the ages of 50 and 70 and classified as overweight. Each participant completed two separate three-week dietary periods in a crossover design, meaning they tried both a ketogenic diet and a standard diet in different phases of the study. There was a one-week break between the two phases. The order of diets was randomized.

During the ketogenic diet phase, participants consumed a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet designed to trigger the production of ketone bodies—molecules the body uses for energy when carbohydrate intake is limited. The diet was composed of approximately 75% fat, 20% protein, and only 5% carbohydrates. Participants were instructed on what to eat and monitored their blood ketone levels twice daily using a flash monitoring device. Those who did not achieve a certain level of ketones in the first week were excluded. During the standard diet phase, participants followed the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations, which emphasize a more conventional balance of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.To assess the impact of each diet, the researchers used a combination of advanced brain imaging techniques. At the end of each diet phase, participants underwent a brain scan using positron emission tomography (PET) to measure blood flow in different regions of the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were also performed to help align and interpret the PET data. On the same day as the PET scan, blood samples were collected to measure levels of the ketone molecule β-hydroxybutyrate and the neurotrophic protein BDNF.The results showed that the ketogenic diet significantly elevated both ketone levels and brain-related outcomes. After three weeks on the ketogenic diet, participants’ blood levels of β-hydroxybutyrate increased more than twelvefold compared to the standard diet. This biochemical marker confirmed that participants had entered a state of nutritional ketosis. More importantly, cerebral blood flow was 22% higher on average during the ketogenic phase compared to the standard diet. 
 
This increase was observed across multiple regions of the brain and was measured with a high level of precision using PET imaging.In addition to improved blood flow, the researchers found that levels of BDNF were 47% higher during the ketogenic diet phase. BDNF is a protein that plays a key role in the growth, maintenance, and survival of neurons. It is often described as “fertilizer” for the brain and is believed to support learning and memory. Reduced BDNF levels have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. While previous research had shown that ketone supplements could increase BDNF in the short term, this study demonstrated that sustained nutritional ketosis can also elevate BDNF levels over time.The study also found a strong correlation between blood ketone levels and cerebral blood flow across the two diet phases. In other words, higher ketone concentrations in the blood were associated with greater brain perfusion. This relationship adds further weight to the idea that ketone metabolism plays a direct role in improving brain function, even in the absence of cognitive deficits.Although the sample size was small—only 11 participants completed the full protocol—the findings were consistent across individuals and backed by rigorous imaging and biochemical assessments. The authors noted that nine participants completed both PET scans, and BDNF data were available for ten participants. Importantly, no serious side effects were reported, and all participants successfully reached and maintained a ketotic state during the ketogenic phase.The research builds on earlier findings from studies involving people with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease, who often experience decreased cerebral blood flow. In those populations, ketogenic diets or ketone supplements have been associated with improvements in brain energy metabolism and function. However, it was previously unclear whether the same benefits would extend to healthy individuals without signs of cognitive decline. 

This new study fills that gap by showing that a ketogenic diet can enhance both blood flow and neurotrophic support in people without existing brain disorders.Low cerebral blood flow has been linked to future cognitive decline in both patients and healthy individuals. Several studies have shown that people with lower blood flow in certain brain areas are more likely to experience memory problems and reduced executive functioning over time. By increasing cerebral perfusion, a ketogenic diet might help protect against such decline, although more research is needed to confirm that possibility.The researchers also highlighted the potential importance of BDNF in brain aging. BDNF helps regulate synaptic plasticity, the ability of the brain to adapt and reorganize itself, which is vital for learning and memory. Lower BDNF levels are commonly observed in people with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. Raising BDNF through diet or other interventions might improve neural resilience and delay the onset of cognitive symptoms.One of the study’s limitations is the small number of participants. While the crossover design helps control for individual variability, a larger sample size would be needed to confirm the generalizability of the results. Another limitation is that the study only included individuals who were overweight, which means the findings might not apply to people of normal weight or those with different metabolic profiles. 
 
Additionally, the intervention lasted just three weeks per diet phase. It is not yet known whether these effects would persist or grow stronger with longer-term adherence to a ketogenic diet.Future research could explore whether similar improvements in cerebral blood flow and BDNF occur in other populations, such as people at risk of dementia, individuals with metabolic syndrome, or even younger adults. Studies could also examine whether these physiological changes translate into measurable improvements in cognitive performance. Finally, it would be useful to compare different types of ketogenic diets, such as those based on plant-based fats versus animal fats, to assess how various nutritional sources influence brain health.The study, “A 3-Week Ketogenic Diet Increases Global Cerebral Blood Flow and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,” was authored by Thien Vinh Luong, Kim Vang Hansen, Allan Kjeldsen Hansen, Stephen C. Cunnane, Niels Møller, Esben Søndergaard, Lars Christian Gormsen, and Mads Svart." Please evaluate the forgoing text, and the article upon which it is based if possible.

How solid is the new keto-for-the-brain claim?
Question	Verdict
Is the PsyPost write-up factually faithful to the study?	Mostly. The reported design (randomised crossover, 11 overweight 50- to 70-year-olds, 3-week ketogenic vs Nordic diet) and the headline figures (≈22 % higher global cerebral blood flow and ≈47 % higher serum BDNF) match the abstract in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism (JCEM). 
psypost.org
academic.oup.com
How persuasive is the study itself?	Strengths: randomised crossover (each participant is their own control); direct PET measurement of perfusion; biochemical verification of ketosis. Weak points: tiny sample (n = 11, only 9 completed PET), short exposure (3 weeks), restricted population (overweight, not frail elderly), no cognitive-performance endpoints, and no long-term safety data. Effect sizes in surrogate markers rarely predict clinical benefit. 
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
academic.oup.com
Does it overturn the case for keeping some carbs?	No. The brain can use ketones, but it still needs a baseline glucose supply. Older adults often face sarcopenia, renal decline, micronutrient deficiencies, polypharmacy, and cardiac arrhythmias—factors that can make strict ketogenic diets hard to sustain or even risky. Larger RCTs and longer follow-up (≥6 months) are still lacking. Existing mixed-macronutrient or “cycling” approaches already show metabolic and cognitive benefits with fewer adherence problems. 
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
How trustworthy is JCEM?	High for endocrine and metabolic clinical research. It is the flagship journal of the Endocrine Society (est. 1916), peer-reviewed, indexed in PubMed/MEDLINE, and carried an Impact Factor ≈5 in 2024—respectable, though not top-tier in neurology. Retractions are rare and transparency policies are standard.

Bottom line
The paper is an interesting proof-of-mechanism but far from definitive. Treat it as an early signal—not a mandate—for lifelong “all-out keto,” especially in the elderly. If cognitive protection is the goal, the evidence base still favours:

Overall cardiometabolic risk reduction (blood-pressure control, exercise, sleep).

Diets rich in poly-unsaturated fats, fibre, and polyphenols (Mediterranean, DASH, MIND).

Possibly periodic keto or exogenous ketone supplementation under clinical supervision.

Until larger, longer trials show actual cognitive gains and safety in diverse older populations, a blanket recommendation to eliminate dietary carbohydrate remains premature.

Does restricting eating to one meal in the evening benefit elderly men?

Does restricting eating to one meal in the evening benefit elderly men?
🗒️ Answer
Metabolic upside is modest and short-term. A controlled trial of evening one-meal-a-day (OMAD) in younger adults cut body-weight and boosted fat oxidation in exercise after 11 days, hinting at improved metabolic flexibility [2]. Similar small studies note fat-loss and lower insulin, but none focused on seniors [1, 4].

Evidence in ≥65-year-olds is sparse and cautionary. Harvard geriatric experts warn that prolonged fasts may aggravate sarcopenia, osteoporosis, medication-timing problems, and dehydration, outweighing any calorie-restriction benefit in older adults [6].

Key risks for elderly men: hypoglycemia on glucose-lowering drugs, dizziness/falls, inadequate protein and micronutrients, and loss of social eating cues [3, 6].

Practical takeaway. A gentler 12-14 h nightly fast or two balanced meals with ≥1.2 g protein / kg plus resistance training is better supported. Evening-only OMAD should be a supervised experiment, not a blanket recommendation for elderly men.

What is a good strategy for building muscle mass, improving metabolic flexibility, and losing a few pounds of body weight?
🗒️ Answer
Lift heavy, often. Perform 3–4 weekly sessions built around compound moves (squats, presses, pulls) and progressive overload to stimulate hypertrophy and raise resting metabolic rate [1] [10].

Eat for recomp. Hold a mild 300-500 kcal daily deficit while hitting 1.6–2.2 g protein /kg body weight; this lets you lose fat yet provide amino acids for growth [2] [5].

Cycle fuel for flexibility. Anchor most days around balanced macros, but add 1–2 higher-carb “refeed” evenings each week to train the switch between fat- and glucose-burning pathways, enhancing metabolic flexibility [3] [4].

Keep moving outside the gym. 7 000–10 000 steps and two brisk 30-min aerobic sessions weekly amplify calorie burn and insulin sensitivity [9].

Protect muscle during weight loss. Prioritize sleep (7–9 h), manage stress, and avoid crash diets; large energy cuts accelerate lean-mass loss [6].

Follow this template for 8–12 weeks, adjust calories every two weeks, and track strength gains and waist circumference to verify progress.
